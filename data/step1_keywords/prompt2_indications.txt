“I would like to add to this list to make sure we get good coverage of the following indications: 
ADD/ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Eating Disorders, Mood Disorders, OCD, Postpartum/Perinatal Depression, Personality Disorders, Phobias, Trauma/PTSD, Schizophrenia, Self-Harm, Sleep, 
Stress & Anxiety, and Substance Use. Can you produce another list of keywords/phrases (one per line) that covers these topics? Don't worry about overlap with the last list.”
