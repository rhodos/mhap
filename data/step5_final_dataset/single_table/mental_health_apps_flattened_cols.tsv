It‚Äôs the same tool as the desktop version but adapted for mobile so you can have Llama Life on the go.  HOW DOES LLAMA LIFE WORK?  If you‚Äôre new here, a big warm hug! (Anddd, where have you been?!)  Llama Life let‚Äôs you set a countdown timer on *every* task. This concept is called ‚Äòtimeboxing‚Äô, and the idea is to create a (positive) constraint around the time we have to do something. The goal is to try and give a task 100% of our attention, until the timer runs out. This helps to increase focus, and gives us the mental space to think about ONE thing at a time.  Llama Life also let‚Äôs you know your total List Time, and the estimated finishing time, so you can be more aware of time passing, and plan your day. We also love celebrating the wins, big or small, so very importantly, you get confetti (woo hoo!) when you finish a task. You can also personalize with color and emoji to get lots of variety and keep things fresh!  Llama Life offers a 7-day free trial, with a Monthly or Annual subscription.

With this routine timer you can not only create a morning routine but organize your schedule for the entire week.  See for yourself using a smart routine timer can be a game-changer for managing ADHD or autism. Five reasons for why you should use an ADHD planner:  1. Get more done by tracking your routine every day 2. Establish powerful routines that stick even if you have ADHD as an adult 3. Wake up excited by having a morning routine 4. Stop ADHD procrastination with guided routine playlists 5. Having an ADHD planner helps you stay on track for your routine  Create a routine with a timer for each task. Quickly enter flow state or ADHD hyperfocus and get in the zone while completing your morning routine. If you are doing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), RoutineFlow is useful for establishing a simple routine.  According to Atomic Habits, routines are context dependent, especially if you have ADHD. That‚Äôs why RoutineFlow helps you build on existing good habits and overwrites bad habits by setting a context for each routine. You always know what‚Äôs happening before your routine, which is really important for your focus. This is even more true if you have problems as an adult with ADHD without a planner for your daily habits.  To help neurodivergent folks or those with ADHD & autism, we also gamify the process of completing a routine by using an immersive timer, so you can challenge yourself to race the clock.  When starting to use this app for building a routine to manage ADHD or to manage autism, there are tons of templates available, like a morning routine or a study routine. Tailored ADHD routines are planned for the future. Choose one of the templates or start from scratch by creating a custom routine.  Features: -AI Task Breakdown for ADHD and autism -A beautiful visual ADHD planner for your week -Track every habit or routine you have -Create multi-step habits, for example a morning routine -Beat ADHD adult related problems with gamification -Assign a timer and an emoji to each task -Get notified whenever it is time to complete a routine -No more getting distracted even if you have ADHD -Finish each task laser focused with a timer -Visualize your habit progress with beautiful statistics -Analytics for time blindness if you have ADHD -Clean dark mode  I‚Äôm an ADHD solo developer building apps, not a big company.

FOR PARENTS:  Encourage your child to take responsibility and complete household chores through Lusha‚Äôs chores app, linking real-world tasks to in-game achievements. This behavior game motivates your child to participate in everyday activities while reinforcing positive behavior and responsibility in a fun and engaging way.  More than a chore app game, Lusha offers concrete support by incorporating advice from mental health programs. Gain access to tools and key information to manage your child's mental health more effectively, ensuring you have the necessary resources to support your family's journey toward better mental health.  Track and share their progress with healthcare professionals through Lusha's dashboard, facilitating informed decision-making and promoting a collaborative approach to your child's mental health management.  FOR YOUR CHILD:  Immerse them in an engaging jungle world where their avatar meets kind animals that help them better understand their mental health and offer practical advice based on cognitive-behavioral approaches (anger management and anxiety).  Lusha is a digital health game that assists them in managing their daily routines (organizer), including completing household chores, developing their emotional skills, and enhancing their social abilities. Based on digitizing cognitive-behavioral therapy modules and positive reinforcement, tasks and behavioral changes made in ""real life"" are linked to in-game rewards to encourage their implementation, allowing you to value the small daily changes that help them live better.  Effectively manage screen time: Lusha allows gaming sessions to be limited to a duration defined by you. Once the set time has elapsed, their avatar becomes tired and needs to rest, encouraging your child to take a break.  A SCIENCE-BASED GAME:  Lusha was developed in collaboration with psychiatrists, psychologists, and families to ensure a suitable and effective game. Although it is not (yet) a medical device, Lusha is a valuable tool in reinforcing your child's mental health.  Please note, Lusha operates on a subscription basis after a free 7-day trial.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.  To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.  And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.  Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:  1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL  A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.  In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.  The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.  You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.  2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS  If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations.  Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.  They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.  The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.  You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.  Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.  3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS  Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.  In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!  4. üåàDAILY ZEN  We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.  Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.  One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.

Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.  Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you‚Äôre truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.  An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you‚Äôll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.  As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.   There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:  - They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back. - Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you‚Äôre creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. - They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.  *It works on Wear OS: you can use it on your watch.

Designed to enhance your moral health, this app helps you recite, affirm, and read positive affirmations daily to reduce anxiety and stress and promote a healthy mindset.  You've probably heard the word ""affirmation"" more than once. Also, you probably heard the expression ""We are what we think"". Let's now figure out how this is connected. Daily affirmations are positive reminders or statements that can be used to encourage, affirm, and motivate yourself or others.

If you don‚Äôt, you risk falling into negative thought patterns or holding yourself back. Daily affirmations do indeed strengthen us by helping us believe in the potential of an action we desire to manifest, just as the law of attraction says.  Self-affirmation is the process of reminding yourself of the values and interests that constitute your true or core self. It‚Äôs taking stock of who you are and what you care about. It encourages you to think and affirm positively about the important things in life and about your mood.  The app's main feature is displaying affirmations on the screen, which are best recited aloud for maximum benefits. You can select from a variety of backgrounds to personalize your experience or use the front camera to have daily affirmations overlaid over your camera picture, like in the mirror, creating an innovative approach.

This occurs spontaneously when we breathe at a pace of five to seven breaths per minute, resulting in calm, restful alertness and other benefits.  About Resonance Frequency  The effects of resonance support the innate ability of our body, nervous system, and emotions to restore themselves. This is achieved by balancing the two complementary branches of the autonomic nervous system, which governs heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, respiration, and other automatic functions.  How is it possible for one breathing technique to do so much? The answer lies within our nervous system. By breathing at your resonance frequency, you enter into an even balance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system:  The sympathetic branch, which moves us toward activity The parasympathetic branch, which moves us toward rest  New Updates Although TBA focuses on Resonance Frequency, we‚Äôve added advanced ratios to expand your breath practice repertoire. These ratios also use our breathing sounds to guide you.  What‚Äôs in the App?  TBA includes: 2 Kids Ratios (Free) 4 Resonance Frequency Ratios (Free) 4 Focusing Breathing Ratios (Premium) 4 Energizing Breathing Ratios (Premium) 4 Calming Breathing Ratios (Premium) 4 Grounding Breathing Ratios (Premium)  Each breath group offers beginner through advanced practices to suit your breathing needs.  All breath practices can be done through both nostrils for normal breathing, or through one nostril at a time for alternate-nostril breathing, giving you flexibility in your practice.

Few people know what a big role breathe exercise plays in the life of each of us.  Correct and deep breathing with the diaphragm allows you to increase the volume of air inhaled by the lungs and improve the saturation of body cells with oxygen. Pranayama completely normalizes the work of the whole organism: equalizes pressure, improves heart function, removes anxiety and stress. According to the lung capacity test: they hold 3-6 liters of air, but usually, our effective volume is just only 400-500 ml of air.  In Pranaria, we have collected the best free breathing exercises based on both ancient Vedic and Sufi prana yoga practices and modern scientific research.  How practices can help: ‚¶ø Prana breathe yoga will help you to relax and focus; ‚¶ø You can use paced pranayama breathing app for anxiety, for asthma, for high blood pressure, and panic attacks. As a result, you can easily and effectively control your emotions; ‚¶ø Lung capacity training: Restore the vital volume; ‚¶ø Inhale exhale timer will increase the level of brain activity: your attention, concentration, and memory; ‚¶ø Learn to induce a state of calmness and relaxation in yourself with the help of proper prana breath and relax control exercise; ‚¶ø Improve the quality and depth of sleep; ‚¶ø Strong lungs exercise, cleansing, and recovery; ‚¶ø Setting up for an important meeting or performance, become more mindful; ‚¶ø Reduced pressure, stress, and anxiety levels.  Strong lungs exercise app Everyone is accustomed to the fact that you can train the muscles of the arms and legs, but in the same way, you can do lung capacity training. The more actively the lungs are ventilated, the more fully they are supplied with blood, and the better our general well-being. Guided prana deep breathing app can help to alleviate general well-being, as well as help, restore lung capacity test. We have developed a special lungs test that measures your current volume with the help o inhale exhale timer. By doing exercises and prana, you can track your current level of lungs capacity and observe it in dynamics.  Pranayama Pranaria is based on a scientific approach: we have adapted the best rhythmic 4 7 8 breathing practices from the Sufi and Vedic systems for daily use. The best workout guided patterns such as 4-7-8 timer, Kapalabhati, Rhythmic, and Intermittent prana breathe relax and focus meditation.  Main functions of the pranayama application ‚Ä¢ 24 workout programs for practicing different types of paced guided breathing meditation to calm and relax, pranayama for confidence, before bed, for lungs checking health, train mindful, famous 478 relax breathwrk practice and many others; ‚Ä¢ Inhale exhale timer with voice instructions and sound notifications; ‚Ä¢ Detailed instructions and recommendations for each workout: how to do prana yoga breathing exercises for anxiety with belly correctly, which position is better, when to inhale and when to exhale; ‚Ä¢ A large number of musical themes and sounds - you can customize each workout and completely immerse yourself in the meditation process.  How long does the workout last? The average duration of each exercise is 7 minutes. In addition, you can customize the duration of each lesson yourself.

It is recommended to choose 1-3 programs and practice regularly in our inhale exhale app. Visible results may appear as early as the first week.

Meditation	4.9	MyMumApp	100,000.00	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhythmic_breathing.app	The way we breathe determines the way we live.  Relaxed, harmonious breathing signifies health, calmness, a steady pace of life, and high stress resistance.  That's meditation, in which the body breathes in step with the mind.  Our breathing depends on our own state of mind and changes along with it. It can therefore vary between being energetic and elevated when we're excited, frequent and shallow when we're stressed, or free, even, and smooth when we're calm and relaxed.  By controlling our breathing, we can manage our own well-being, calm our emotions, and improve our health.  Deep, relaxed breathing improves the exchange of gases in our lungs, affects the functioning of all internal organs, and reduces stress. We become calmer, more relaxed, and thus more successful. Our quality of life improves, we have more energy and strength, and our health improves.  In this app you'll find:  ‚ú¶ simple practice of relaxing breathing ‚ú¶ possibility to set your own breathing rhythms ‚ú¶ rhythms that are suggested by Yantra yoga, the Tibetan yoga of breath and movement ‚ú¶ statistics of your activities ‚ú¶ personal training settings: sound, rhythm pace, voice guidance ‚ú¶ interesting information about breathing	Nov 17, 2024		0.6481614765						Round A	Mental Health	Mental Health	Vocalization/Breathwork, Other	General		General	Y	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

CBT is Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is effective and commonly used for a variety of mental health concerns. ‚ÄòC‚Äô is for cognitive and refers to what and how we think. ‚ÄòB‚Äô is for behavioral or how we act. Cognitive-Behavioral is about the relationship between our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.  Those thoughts, emotions, and behaviours connect to our moods, our physical experiences, and events in our lives. Being aware of how negative thoughts about an event or experience might be affecting how we act, or perceive a situation, can change our emotional, behavioural and physical responses to it.  TELUS Health CBT is CBT delivered by a therapist through an app. Combining a personalized therapist-guided program with digital tools and exercises to bring CBT to life wherever and whenever needed.  Mobile access. Therapy that meets you where you are.  Digital therapy means easy access available 24/7 from any mobile device making it easy to incorporate therapy into your daily life without the additional time and travel requirements of in-person therapy.  Supported by a trained CBT therapist  Every program includes a dedicated CBT therapist who will review all of the work and activities in the program. The therapist will guide the treatment plan accordingly, which may mean suggesting new activities or revisiting modules. The therapist is also available through via messaging to offer feedback and support.  Interactive exercises and activities  Each module contains activities, videos and assignments to help you learn, develop and practice new skills. Activities are seen by your therapist who will review and provide direction and support.  How it works  All programs will start with a clinically validated screening which assesses for depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mania, sleep, and other mental health conditions.  The therapist will review the screening results to create a personalized program.  Each program contains a series of modules that follow an established CBT framework: assessing your current state, education and lessons, skill building, reinforcement and reassessment. The therapist will guide you throughout by reviewing and providing feedback on all exercises and modules. When you are ready the therapist will make the next module available in your program.

We created this app to help you balance your 7 Chakras. Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body.The most important ones are seven, and they influence your life flow.  In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.  How to Balance your Chakras?  Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain tones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.  The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. This app was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.  We put a lot of passion in creating this app, so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life. For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.  *Chakra Meditation Balancing includes* - 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras - A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name. Now you can choose whether to log your timer sessions to the Health app as ""Mindful Minutes"". - The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.  This 7 Chakra Meditation for Body Healing and Cleansing app will help you to perform chakra activation and manage your energy within your body. This app includes all 7 chakra meditations audio and 3 special categories;  1. Root Chakra 2. Sacral Chakra 3. Solar Plexus Chakra 4. Heart Chakra 5. Throat Chakra 6. Third Eye Chakra 7. Crown Chakra 8. 7 Chakra Meditation 9. Chakra Meditation Collection 10. Chakra Meditation Handbook  What are chakras?  A chakra is a Sanskrit word that means wheel. In yoga and meditation, the chakras are wheels or discs located all over the body. There are seven main chakras aligned with the spine. They start from the base of the spine and move in a straight line, along the spine, through the crown. When energy flows unobstructed through these energy centers, your body, mind, and soul will appreciate the coordination and good health. Any obstruction to this flow could harm your overall well-being.  How does chakra healing work?  A series of major and minor energy centers - called chakras - exist in the body. The chakras are the energy centers of the physical body, where your beliefs and emotions are transformed into your state of health.  What are the benefits of healing the chakra?  Healing through the chakra is said to be able to cure almost any mental illness or disease. The process restores balance for each of the chakra sites, as it is believed that if the chakra has too much or too little energy, it will not function properly. The East Indian philosophy behind the healing of the chakras states that body and mind are connected and that a healthy body is a body in which the energies associated with each chakra are balanced and in harmony.  Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ This app is very beautiful and the music has so much relaxation in it.

There is a considerable emphasis in the app on DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), including its origin in the 1970s when Marsha Linehan developed it. The app provides a detailed explanation of DBT and how it differs from other types of psychotherapy. In addition, the four essential skills of DBT are explained not only in writing but also with DBT skills sheets and video presentations.

Believe you can do it, keep trying and you will get there.‚Äô  Worth Warrior is a free app created for young people to manage negative body image, low self-worth, and related early-stage eating difficulties or disorders. Created for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Dr Krause, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, in collaboration with young people, the app uses principles from the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E).  Like all stem4's award winning apps, it is free, private, anonymous, and safe.  The app provides a range of helpful activities and information, based on the notion that through learning to challenge and change thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and body image issues underlying low self-worth, eating and body related issues can be helped.  By identifying these underlying factors, and monitoring them over time, you can also start to identify what your triggers and maintaining factors are and work towards making positive change.  The ‚ÄòChange the Story‚Äô section of the app helps identify negative self thought and learn how to substitute positive self-thoughts. ‚ÄòChange the Action‚Äô focuses on identifying negative behaviours and altering them. In ‚ÄòChange the Emotion‚Äô users are provided with alternative, self soothing behaviours to manipulate their eating and in ‚ÄòChange the way I view my Body‚Äô users are taught how to separate fact from assumption.  There is also a range of information within the app for users to learn more about eating disorders, such as the importance of regular eating and hunger, the health consequences of eating-related behaviours, and issues that maintain eating disorders.  The app also allows users to build a ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô of helpful thoughts, behaviours and people to contact, and signposts to help. Finally, users can monitor and keep track of which app activities help, record thoughts and feelings in a journal, and view daily motivators.  We understand the importance of privacy and so no identifiable data is collected in the app and no WIFI access or data is required.  It is built to NHS standards.  Please note that the Worth Warrior app is an aid in treatment but does not replace it.  Worth Warrior is the latest app in stem4‚Äôs digital portfolio of apps that use evidence-based principles to help young people manage the symptoms of mental health difficulties and disorders. As of June 2022, stem4‚Äôs existing apps (Calm Harm, Clear Fear, Combined Minds and Move Mood) have been downloaded over 3.25 million times, and have received various awards including:  - The Digital Leaders 100 Awards ‚ÄòTech for Good Initiative of the Year‚Äô in 2020, for stem4‚Äôs full app portfolio  - The Health Tech Awards Winner ‚ÄòBest Healthcare App of the Year‚Äô in 2021, for Calm Harm  - The CogX Awards Winner in ‚ÄòGood Health and Well-Being‚Äô in 2020, for Clear Fear	Dec 13, 2024		0.2202015299						Round B	Mental Health	Mental Health	Educational Content, Journaling	Youth		Eating Disorders		False	False	True	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True

With Bertie, you can take control to break the binge cycle and find food freedom.  HOW BERTIE WORKS Because everyone‚Äôs recovery journey is different, Bertie integrates features from different psychological approaches including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness, Self-compassion, and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) to provide you with a complete toolbox for recovery.  Bertie helps you overcome binge eating in 5 key ways:  1. Monitoring & Identifying patterns Monitoring your meals/snacks provides you with important information about your eating habits and can help you identify patterns in your binge eating. Unlike monitoring you may have done in the past, you are not encouraged to count calories or limit your intake. This is about gathering information about your eating patterns in a non-judgemental way to enable you to make changes. By systematically monitoring your eating, you can gain awareness about particular patterns and triggers. Ther Bertie app provides customisable reminders to log each of your meals and snacks. The charts enable you to clearly visualise your emotional and binging patterns over time.  2. Restoring regular eating Restoring a pattern of regular eating is the most effective approach to overcome binge eating. In accordance with CBT (the frontline treatment for binge eating), It is recommended that you eat 3 meals and 3 snacks each day. The exact time of your meals and snacks can be customised to suit your schedule (in the app settings), however try not to leave long gaps (e.g., >4 hours) between meals/snacks, as this can create psychological and physiological pressure to eat, which can result in a binge.  3. Building your mindfulness muscle Binge-eating often involves being disconnected from one‚Äôs body and being on auto-pilot. You may find you feel like you are out of control, and have difficulty describing how you feel prior to a binge. Practicing mindfulness can help you improve your eating behaviour by increasing awareness of your bodily sensations, emotions, and thoughts. This in turn can support you to respond more consciously and compassionately to situations, such as your common triggers or difficult emotions. The Bertie app has a unique meditation program tailored to support your recovery journey.  4. Effectively managing strong urges to binge On the path to recovery, you will likely experience urges to binge. While urges can feel overwhelming and irresistible, it‚Äôs important to know that all urges will rise to a peak and then gradually decrease in intensity. The Bertie app uses a unique SOS support tool, to help you manage intense urges. In these critical moments, Bertie guide you step-by-step to get out of auto-pilot, calm your nervous system, and respond with intention.  5. Promoting social connection and community It might feel like you are the only person struggling with binge eating, but the reality is there are millions of people going through similar experiences. We know that social support and community are two of the most important factors when recovering from binge eating, so Bertie provides an opportunity for both via our moderated social networking forum. Find your people, share information, and get support from others who‚Äôve been through the same thing.

The goal of this is to support the desensitization process step, one of the key components part of the EMDR process.  For the benefit of user convenience, various preferences can be set inside the app with regard to the movement pattern, the color and size of the ball, the background color and the sound effect to be played. It is also possible for some settings to choose for the 'random' option and there are several settings for so-called 'surprise effects'.  Because of the simple user interface of the app, it is also very suitable for children. Furthermore a number of sound effects, as well as the surprise effect of suddenly appearing pictures, will have a positive effect on the imagination of the young user.  Background:  This app is realized in close cooperation with a professional operating in the domain of the mental health care.  The functionality of the app is based on the principle of the much discussed EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) used for trauma processing under the supervision of a professional. The developers of this app therefore advice to only use this app to support therapy by a certified practitioner.  Besides the treatment of trauma the working area of EMDR is expanding strongly. For example experiments have been started with compulsive behavior, persistent cravings and overpowering itch. Since the aspect of self practice with these kind of complaints is already a standardized part of the treatment, it is our expectation that a self-help app like this will obtain a reasonable amount of applicability exactly in this area.  This app is offered for the once only symbolic amount of 1 Euro excl.¬†VAT. The revenue will be used for the purpose of (free) updates to adjust the app even better to the needs of the user based on the received feedback.  Usage:  When you start the app, the menu screen is shown. In the top of this screen you can see the menu bar with the options menu, a control panel in the bottom of the screen and a small status bar in the top left. In the status bar you can see the pattern you have selected, the sound effect you have chosen and the current motion speed.  In the control panel buttons are present to start and stop the movement of the ball. In this panel you can also control the speed and a button is present to activate the full-screen mode. From the full-screen mode it is possible to return to the menu screen by touching the screen in an arbitrary position.  Besides English, this app also supports the languages Spanish, French, German and Dutch.	2.16d	Mental Health	0.00786779355		Other	EMDR support	General	General	Round B	Mental Health	Mental Health	Talk Therapy / Coaching - AI/Digital, Other	General		Trauma / PTSD, General		False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.  Because bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest!

EMDR is a technique recommended by psychotherapists and Psychologists.  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an extensively researched psychotherapy method proven to be effective and help people recover from trauma and other distressing life experiences which are including depression, PTSD, panic disorders, anxiety.  The American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs/Dept. of Defense, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the World Health Organization among many other national and international organizations recognize and recommend EMDR therapy as an effective treatment.  First, put on your headphones, think of a traumatic and disturbing event. Follow the ball in the EMDR tool, focus on the transition of sounds in your left and right ears, and feel the vibrations. Thus, the effect of traumatic disturbing events that will provide the data flow between the right and left brain as in REM sleep will decrease. Focus on the trauma memory while simultaneously experiencing bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements), which is associated with a reduction in the vividness and emotion associated with the trauma memories. While you bring the details of that memory to mind, This tool will guide you through a series of side-to-side eye movements, auditory (with direction), and vibrations. As you learn to process the memory and related feelings it brings up, you‚Äôll gradually be able to reframe that memory in a more positive light.  Use three types of BLS: visual, auditory (with direction), and vibrations and modify your settings to suit your preferences. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro in the 1980s that was originally designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In EMDR, the person being treated recalls distressing experiences whilst doing bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye movement or physical stimulation, such as tapping either side of the body.  According to the theory behind the approach, traumatic and painful memories can cause post-traumatic stress when you don‚Äôt process them completely. Then, when sights, sounds, words, or smells trigger those unprocessed memories, you re-experience them.  The 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) practice guideline states that EMDR ""is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements.  This re-experiencing leads to the emotional distress and other symptoms recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR aims to reduce symptoms of trauma by changing how your memories are stored in your brain. In a nutshell, an EMDR therapist does this by leading you through a series of bilateral (side-to-side) eye movements as you recall traumatic or triggering experiences in small segments, until those memories no longer cause distress."

By applying the EMDR psychotherapy, a person can:   ‚óè   Decrease effect of disturbing memories   ‚óè   Decrease post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms   ‚óè   Decrease phobia and panic disorder symptomsThe EMDR protocol includes desensitization of negative emotions associated with painful memories, and consequently reprocessing those memories from a current, healthier perspective. The desensitization effect is achieved by appropriate dual attention stimulation of the left and right brain hemispheres. Under proper conditions, reprocessing happens naturally, using innate healing capacities of the brain. Eye movement is one of the ways to trigger desensitization and reprocessing, not unlike the process happening during a dreamful sleep, in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase.See for more info www.emdrtrisense.com	Jan 1, 2024		0.4974854632						Round B	Mental Health	Mental Health	Talk Therapy / Coaching - AI/Digital, Other	General		Trauma / PTSD		False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

By quitting smoking with this program you can expect your health to start to improve; you‚Äôll have more energy and vitality, increase your life expectancy, have less stress, enjoy younger looking skin, fresh breath and whiter teeth. Plus you‚Äôll have more money and healthier loved ones.  Using hypnosis is the most effective way of stopping smoking for good according to a study by New Scientist (Vol 136 Issue 1845).  Embark on our QUIT program now for a radical change in your behavior and quit smoking once and for all. Because to QUIT smoking you have to cultivate the belief and feeling that you are a non smoker. Hypnosis allows you to get directly to the root of the problem and therefore change your beliefs and feelings about smoking forever.  This easy to follow program will allow you to really see how smoking has been manipulating you. Each audio has been specifically designed to destroy all the facets of your addiction to smoking so that you can enjoy a happier, healthier and smoke free life.  Hypnosis is a powerful tool, but it still can sometimes need complimentary therapy or counseling sessions in conjunction with this. As it highly depends on how much work the user is willing to invest this series does not guarantee complete stopping of smoking for everyone.

Set up a habit 2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day 3. Watch your daily streak increase  Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.  To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).  HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.  There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills. It is entirely up to you, really. But why not give it a try and have a convenient helper on the go?

Forming a new habit in 21 days never worked for us because we've made it too challenging. Nothing kills our motivation faster than failing to finish a task 10 times in a row.  On the other hand, small wins help stabilize our new habits, and we can gradually increase the intensity. Listen to the science of Tiny Habits, and you'll see amazing results. Ignore science, and we go back to blame our lack of willpower.  Tips for setting goals  Achievable goals must be Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound. ""Be healthy"" alone is more of a statement than a goal. An achievable goal could be ""Live a healthy lifestyle by the end of the year"" with steps: 1. Choose a healthier diet. 2. Exercise twice a week. 3. Sleep before 11 pm. 4. Floss and shower every day.  Tips for staying motivated and less stressed  The problem with to-do apps today is they are training us to focus on an endless list of tasks instead of our long term vision. This infinite list causes our stress. There is not enough time.  To set yourself free, acknowledge your time is limited and focus your North Star. Higher Goals helps you identify your North Star and then displays it prominently to unlock your intrinsic motivation.  Features  ‚Ä¢ Daily, weekly, and monthly repeated habits ‚Ä¢ Streak stats and weekly completion trends ‚Ä¢ Track SMART goals with percentage visualization ‚Ä¢ Capture photos when you check off habits ‚Ä¢ Shift mindsets and align your goals with your North Star ‚Ä¢ Customizable header images and colors ‚Ä¢ Sync between multiple devices ‚Ä¢ Works offline ‚Ä¢ Dark mode  Influences  These books heavily influenced us, and we're continuing to improve the app by integrating more powerful habit-forming techniques.  ‚Ä¢ ""Tiny Habits"" ‚Ä¢ ""Atomic Habits"" ‚Ä¢ ""The Miracle Mornings"" ‚Ä¢ ""The One Thing"" ‚Ä¢ ""The Power of Habit"" ‚Ä¢ ""Mindset"" ‚Ä¢ ""Nudge"" ‚Ä¢ ""How will you measure your life?""

This app allows you to monitor, record and analyze your bad habits to increase your self-control and improve your lifestyle.  How does the habit tracking app work? It is said that it takes 21 days to form a new habit, so why not give it a try. To get started, all you need to do is enter the type of habit, the name and the start date. Goals will be met as time increases.  Which habits can be stopped? There is no limitation, since the icons of addictions are simply indicative and you can write your own addiction, although among the predefined ones there are the following: Quitting alcohol, drugs, tobacco, junk food, social networks, video games, porn, nofap, gambling, coffee, weed, and a long etcetera.  Relapse counter If you ever have a relapse, it is very easy to reset the counter. You only have to indicate how much time or money you have lost and it will be deducted from the total.  Habits Widget If you want to always have a particular habit at hand, you have the possibility to create a widget to view it from the application menu of your phone.  Habit statistics and calendar We have worked to create an intuitive app, so all the information has been condensed into a single view. The habits calendar shows all the relapses during the month. You can see all the time or money saved through abstaining and savings forecasts from the week to the century.  Types of bad habits and addictions You can choose 3 types of addictions: 1. Those that make you lose money 2. Those that make you waste time 3. The ones that make you lose energy and vitality  Customization of habits Unlike other apps, this application allows you to change the color of addictions whenever you want and totally free. There are a total of 12 gradients specially designed to match each other.  Daily notifications Every time you achieve a new goal or progress in your addiction, you will receive a new push notification congratulating you on your new achievement. The habit goals are the first 24h, 3 days, 10 days and so on until the year, in which the habit is considered to be more than overcome. Of course, this option is optional and you can disable it at any time.  Affirmation of the day To boost your confidence and motivation, a daily affirmation is displayed. It has been proven that daily affirmations are able to increase people's confidence, security and perseverance.  Security PIN If you want to keep your privacy and no one can see what addictions you are trying to quit, the Security PIN is ideal for you. With just 3 steps, you will be able to create a code that will be requested every time you open the app.	Jul 16, 2025		0.4670037677						Round B	Mental Health	Mental Health	Other	General		Substance Use / Addiction, General		False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

This smoking cessation app is designed for people who smoke less than daily. ‚ÄúSiS‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúSmiling instead of Smoking‚Äù - the app uses a positive psychology approach to support you in quitting smoking. Smoking is dangerous for everyone, even for people who smoke less than daily. Smoking as few as 6-10 cigarettes per month can substantially impact your health.  The app was designed by scientists based on existing evidence and clinical guidelines regarding smoking cessation [https://cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/clearing-the-air]. The research informing this app was funded by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute.  Each day, the app gives you specific tasks. These tasks introduce you to the app‚Äôs tools. Each task is timed specifically with regards to your chosen quit day, so that each day the app gives you the task most relevant to you that day. For best results, we recommend using the app every day for 7 weeks: for the 1 week leading up to your chosen quit day (prep work is important!), and the 6 weeks following your quit day.  Each day, the app will ask you to: - Complete a happiness exercise - Log your cigarettes ‚Äì or confirm that you were smoke free - Complete a specific task using one of the app‚Äôs tools; these tasks include, for example, specifying your personal reasons for quitting smoking, browsing strategies to overcome your smoking triggers, learning about benefits of quitting smoking, practicing resisting the urge to smoke, seeing how much money you saved by not smoking, etc.  Why work on happiness to quit smoking?  How we feel impacts what we can do. When we feel angry, stressed, or sad, it is difficult to take on a challenging task, like quitting smoking. But when we feel good, we have strength, confidence and energy to tackle hard tasks.  Science has shown that feeling happier: - Decreases your urge to smoke - Increases your confidence to quit smoking - Gives you courage to act upon the fact that smoking is bad for you - Makes you more creative, so that instead of lighting up, you can choose to do something else in that moment  In this app, we ask you to work on your happiness. Each day, we ask you to complete a Habit-Building Exercise. Completing these exercises gets you in the habit of noticing the good things in your life, and lets you draw strength from them.  Happiness can also help in the moment of craving. Try out the ‚ÄúHappiness Boost Activities‚Äù to feel happier within minutes. And, at the end of a day: a happier life is a happier life! That‚Äôs why we believe in smiling instead of smoking.   Scientific Evidence Supporting This App  You can read about our scientific work on this app here:  Hoeppner, B. B., Siegel, K. R., Carlon, H.

Regardless of how long you've dealt with this issue, Relay was designed to address the root causes of unwanted behavior so that you can find sobriety, heal inner wounds, and restore deeper intimacy and connection in your relationships.  WHO IT'S FOR Relay is a comprehensive, 16-week program for anyone seeking recovery from sexual addiction (quitting porn or other compulsive sexual behavior).  We offer private groups for both men and women (separated by gender).  Our program is perfect for those who have tried other options but felt like something was missing. Relay gives you a clear, structured path to help you rewire your brain and actually solve the underlying problems that have kept you stuck ‚Äî not just put a band-aid on it like internet blockers do (sorry, Covenant Eyes).  WHY RELAY IS UNIQUE Developed together with licensed therapists who have 40+ years of combined addiction expertise, Relay's program provides interactive video lessons, a private accountability group, and variety of psychology-based tools to help you slow down the addictive cycle and replace it with a healthy system for renewal and fulfilled living.  We start by helping you craft a personalized plan for your unique situation, which we'll review with you in a 15-minute phone call during Week 1.  The more you check-in and record your data, the better able Relay is to surface patterns and help you make intelligent adjustments to be more successful.  The biggest reason people choose Relay is for the tight-knit group format. Within your team, you can stay anonymous to protect your confidentiality while still gaining access to true connection and shame-free accountability. All communication happens via secure group chat in the app, but you can also join live meetings via Zoom if you want to go deeper (hint ‚Äî most people LOVE the live meetings despite feeling nervous to jump in at first).  In summary, Relay's program is great for people who want a deeper, comprehensive approach that includes therapist-created lessons, group-based accountability, and personalized feedback. It's a human-centric approach to recovery.  TESTIMONIALS  -> ""This program has changed my life in 6 months."" - Matthew  -> ""You cannot put a price tag on this platform. What you get out of it pays for itself."" - Bryan  -> ""Relay has provided a source of constant encouragement and sense of community that no other program I've seen can do!"" - James  PRICING Our mission is to build a platform that is 10x easier and more effective than anything else out there.  We are a very small team with limited funding, and we're doing our best to stay afloat with the current economy. By charging a reasonable fee, it allows us to support the costs of enlisting a world-class team of psychologists and technical folks needed to continue to expand the program resources. Please check out all of our reviews below if you want to hear from real customers about why Relay has been worth it for them.  To make the investment zero risk, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee: if you don‚Äôt find the program helpful to you after 30 days, we'll help you obtain a refund. Additionally, we never want cost to be the barrier for anyone serious about getting help, so we offer limited scholarships to help provide access to people who truly can't afford the cost.

AntiSocial is designed to not only help you understand what ‚Äònormal usage‚Äô looks like, but to give you the tools to manage, block and control your cell phone usage so that you can unplug, minimize distractions and focus on the things that matter. While there are other apps available that are designed to restrict phone usage, AntiSocial feels strongly about empowering the user by giving them the information they need to take necessary action. This is done through the clearest and most simple interface available and is the only app to deliver detailed reports full of all the information you need to make an informed decision.  What makes AntiSocial unique? ‚òÖ Your cell phone usage will be benchmarked against all other users. Get an understanding of what is ‚Äònormal usage‚Äô ‚òÖ Phone does not need to be unlocked and screen doesn‚Äôt need to be on for AntiSocial to work ‚òÖ Least impact on battery life and data ‚òÖ Simple and easy to understand regular reports ‚òÖ Most accurate data available ‚òÖ Extremely user friendly interface ‚òÖ Comprehensive customer support for users ‚òÖ Ad Free - Forever  So how does it work?  Once installed, AntiSocial works in the background of your phone without you even knowing it. It accumulates all of your activity and delivers an easy to understand report.  More importantly, you will be able to learn whether you use your phone more or less than everyone else. Knowledge is power, and from there it‚Äôs up to you whether you want or need to take action to control your cell phone usage. The app offers the ability to manage, block apps and restrict usage but again, this is entirely up to the user. AntiSocial empowers you to take control of your phone time and minimize distraction. We understand that controlling cell phone usage may be a bigger problem for some than others which is why on top of delivering information to the user, you can also take action by blocking apps, disabling apps and restricting your usage to give you some much needed off time if you‚Äôre feeling addicted. And while it may not be a catastrophic problem yet, it is becoming harder for us to unplug and disconnect from our phones. We understand it can be difficult to avoid the distraction of our cell phones, especially when it comes to studying, working or downtime. The ability to block games and block social media can go a long way to achieving a better mental state and minimizing distraction so you can focus on what‚Äôs important.  Free with no ads.

Confidant is something new and different in addiction recovery.  Most addiction recovery clinics focus on 12-step based abstinence-focused sobriety. For many people, that path is outdated and doesn‚Äôt fit the lifestyle of those who haven‚Äôt hit ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù.  We know there are millions of people, like us, who want to change the way they‚Äôre using drugs and alcohol without having to put their life on hold by going to drug rehab or an intensive outpatient program for the next 30 days to get sober.  So, we teamed up with modern-recovery researchers and patient advocates to dive into the latest scientific evidence and medical knowledge to uncover the best way to make changes to your alcohol or drug use.  What we found was a simpler way - focused on the person, not just the substance. You should not have have to uproot your life, question every choice you‚Äôve ever made, and become an unrecognizable person.  Addiction recovery should be person-centered, straightforward and judgment free. Whether that means Medication-Assisted Treatment like Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. or online therapy we support a variety of paths.  Here‚Äôs how Confidant works:  - Download the app - Start ReVAMP- our behavior change platform - Speak with providers who can help you in 1:1 therapy - Book online therapy appointments right in the app - Meet with healthcare providers on your phone (they can help with Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. if appropriate)  We provide everyone who uses Confidant access to a Matchmaker, who acts as your personal concierge and can answer any questions you may have and get you connected to all these resources.  Not interested in talking with someone about this yet? We get it. Talking about substance use is hard and it takes time to build trust. That‚Äôs why we created ReVAMP to guide you.  ReVAMP is our DIY behavior change program. Simply answer questions about your goals, activities and feelings and it will help you identify your core values. Next ReVAMP produces a personalized plan to help you unlock your best self by drinking less, using drugs less or quitting altogether.  At Confidant, we don‚Äôt judge. We‚Äôre here to help you and that‚Äôs it.  Confidant Health is perfect if you want to:  - Drink less - Quit drinking - Get sober - Use drugs less - Quit drugs - Connect with a Recovery Coach - Consider sobriety - Learn about Substance Use Disorder (SUD), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) - Get online therapy - Receive Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) - Receive Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. - Join an online addiction recovery support group - Explore online rehab or virtual addiction recovery services - Educate yourself on addiction recovery including AA, NA, holistic therapy, evidence-based approaches and beyond. - Something more than a drink tracker, sobriety tracker or habit tracker - Online alternative to addiction treatment centers - Learn about medications for opioid use - Learn about medications for alcohol use - Just feel better!  Who will be helping you at Confidant Health?  You may connect with prescribers who can help with Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) using Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine and others.  We also have addiction recovery coaches who can help you better understand your relationship to drugs, alcohol and/or your own journey through their own lived experience.  Confidant Health also has therapists ready to discuss addiction recovery from just using drugs less or drinking less all the way to sobriety. Regardless of your own journey Confidant Health is judgment free and can help you attain your mental health goals.  Download the app. Give us a try and let us know what you think.

It helps you understand your alcohol consumption in a way that truly makes sense. Most people don't realize how much they‚Äôre drinking or how it compares to recommended guidelines. DrinkControl changes that by converting your drinks into standard alcohol units and showing you the bigger picture.  ‚ÄúMakes it clear that one glass of wine is not always ‚Äòjust one drink.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   Your Smart Alcohol Diary  More than a log ‚Äî it‚Äôs your accountability partner. Track what, when, and how much you drink. Non-judgemental with full privacy (data stays on your device only). App helps you stay accountable and notice patterns in your drinking habits. Whether you're trying to cut back, stick to certain days, or simply stay more mindful, this app keeps you on track.  ‚ÄúThis app helped me reduce my drinking by simply making me aware.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   Not All Drinks Are Equal  We often think in glasses and bottles ‚Äî not units. But not all beers, wines, or cocktails contain the same amount of alcohol. DrinkControl takes the guesswork out of the equation by converting every drink into standard alcohol units and grams of pure alcohol, based on real guidelines from health institutions.  ‚ÄúReally opens your eyes when you see how many units are in a few ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô drinks.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   Calories Count Too  Alcohol doesn‚Äôt just affect your liver ‚Äî it affects your waistline too. Drinks are full of empty (without any nutritional value) calories. DrinkControl helps you stay aware of the calories in your drinks, making it easier to manage your weight, cut down for health reasons, or save money.  ‚ÄúThis app helped me lose weight and drink less at the same time.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  A little tracking goes a long way.   Top Features  - Quick logging of drinks and alcohol expenses - Calendar view of your drinking patterns - Mark dry days and build sober streaks - Charts, trend-line and statistics on alcohol/calories consumed, money spent on drinks - Compare your intake against global health guidelines  Whether you're sober-curious, cutting back, or just want to stay in control ‚Äî DrinkControl is your personal alcohol awareness companion.   Real User Experiences  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just started my third year of using DrinkControl. Of course, this is a tool, not a magic bullet. Yet it has helped me help myself. I have halved my consumption each year, meaning this year I‚Äôm drinking 1/8(!!!) the amount I consumed 4yrs ago.‚Äú ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been tracking drinks with this app for quite awhile and did get the premium version to keep better track. It has really helped me to see how much I overconsume without even realizing it.‚Äú ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  ‚ÄúWake up to yet another sober day under your belt and let this app celebrate you for it. This is your cheerleader to leading a life free from alcohol! Great app!‚Äú ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ   App website: https://drinkcontrol.app  Awareness is the first step toward change.

Join over 400,000 users! If you are looking to enhance your rest, relaxation, and concentration, our brain wave app can help you! Join more than 400,000 users who have benefited from the refreshing effects of binaural beats. You can begin to feel more relaxed and more focused, with less stress and anxiety, in just minutes.  What are Binaural Beats They were first discovered in 1839 by German physicist Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. When two tones of slightly different frequencies are presented separately, one to each ear, the brain responds by creating a third tone, which is equal to the difference between the two frequencies.  Researchers have found that these brain waves are beneficial to a person in many ways, including by helping to improve your focus and concentration, lessening stress, calming your emotions, improving the quality of your sleep, and increasing your drive and energy.  Seamless Background Playback Continue listening to binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies, ambient sounds, breathwork, and custom mixes while using other apps or when your screen is off. Easily control playback through the media notification - play, pause, or stop your audio without returning to the app. Just pause and swipe left on the notification to close the playback completely.  How to use Binaural Beats Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Once you are settled, you will need to wear headphones and listen to the track for 30-60 minutes.This is because each ear needs to hear a different frequency in order for the binaural beat to be produced.  Isochronic Tones Isochronic tones are an alternative brain wave type of technology to Binaural Beats and can be used without headphones. They work in a similar fashion, by entraining to different frequencies. However in the case of Isochronic Tones we listen to pulses of sounds at different frequencies, encouraging a certain brain wave state.  Ambient Sounds Whether it's the sound of raindrops or the gentle crashing of waves against a shoreline, these ambient sounds can help you feel more calm and serene. In addition to promoting feeling good, ambient sounds can also help boost your concentration by blocking out external noise.  Breathwork The benefits of breathwork are vast and well-documented. When we breathe deeply and slowly, it has a profound impact on the nervous system, helping to calm the mind and relax the body. Breathwork has also been shown to improve the quality of sleep, increase energy levels, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote overall well-being. Use our Breathwork techniques to improve your overall wellbeing.  Features: - No network is required - Over 100 pre-generated beats! - Listen without headphones using isochronic tones - Create your own custom Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma brainwaves - Breathwork - Solfeggio Frequencies - Ambient Sounds - Timer to automatically and smoothly fade out the sounds - Background listening while using other apps - Create your own brainwave playlists - Noise Block  For best results *Volume should ALWAYS be set at the lower side of a comfortable level. *High volumes will NOT enhance the effects. . *Use isochronic tones when trying to listen to these brain waves without headphones. *Use ambient sounds to make the beats sound better.

This is achieved through pineal gland stimulation using brainwave entrainment music. The result of elevated consciousness is an increase in our natural extrasensory abilities. With elevated consciousness, awareness, creativity, extrasensory perception, and intuition are all increased.  The third eye serves as the connection to all knowledge and endless creativity. The pineal gland is stimulated through the use of isochronic modulation which is the most advanced form of brainwave entrainment. Through brainwave entrainment, elevated states of delta, alpha, theta, beta or gamma wave are increased and the mind is placed into the proper meditative state.  With daily Pinealwave meditation the third eye will be opened and consciousness will be elevated. The power and potential of meditation being used to activate the pineal gland has been known and used by many cultures throughout the history of mankind.  THE POWER OF THIRD EYE OPENING  The concept of the third eye is a spiritual and philosophical one that is found in various cultures and belief systems around the world. It is often associated with the pineal gland, which is a small gland in the brain that is believed to regulate the body's circadian rhythms. Here are some of the potential benefits that are associated with opening the third eye:  Increased intuition: Opening the third eye is said to enhance your ability to perceive and understand subtle energies and to trust your intuition. Clarity of mind: By activating the third eye, you may experience greater mental clarity and focus, as well as an improved ability to concentrate and retain information. Spiritual insight: Third eye awakening can lead to deeper understanding of spiritual concepts and experiences, including meditation, mindfulness, and yoga. Enhanced creativity: By opening the third eye, you may experience greater inspiration and creativity, as well as an increased ability to access your imagination. Improved health: Some people believe that opening the third eye can improve physical health by regulating the body's internal rhythms and promoting overall balance and harmony.

Hypnosis is a state of human consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion. The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis. Meditation and its effect on brain activity and the central nervous system became a focus of collaborative research in neuroscience, psychology and neurobiology during the latter half of the 20th century. Mindfulness meditation is frequently studied, a Buddhist meditation approach found in Zen and Vipassana.   A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear."

Binaural beats are the best way of relaxing your mind using the power of music. This works because of the fact that our brain communicates by generating electricity. These are called the brain waves. Our brain generates a specific brain waves for specific emotions. This is called the brain wave state.

Binaural beats are namely Delta waves, Theta waves, Alpha waves, Beta waves and Gamma waves. They each help you to reach a special state that you desire. The Delta waves helps you in better sleep. So, if you have any problem while sleeping you can go into deep sleep listening to it. If you are feeling tired, stressed or in anxiety then Theta waves will help you to get in deep relaxation, emotional connection and creativity. Alpha waves are used to feel relaxed and Gamma are used to make you feel hig.  We compose instrumental music that is specially designed to encourage and enhance relaxation, meditation, brain function and concentration, spa and massage therapy, healing music therapy and hypnosis therapy.

After years of research our sound waves are carefully designed to help you heal psychological problems, reduce stress, relax mind, reduce pain, improve mood, and many more.  Listening to Binaural Beats or Isochronic Tones are powerful methods to relax or stimulate the brain for meditation, concentration or sleep. Even more powerful are videos with a combination of Binaural Beats and Isochronic Tones. You can easily get access to your subconscious brain, study and get into a deep state of meditation. The only thing you have to do is listen to them with headphones or ear buds.  Binaural beats are an auditory illusion where two tones of different frequencies are heard in each ear. Due to the frequency difference, the brain perceives a third tone, the binaural beat. This binaural beat has the frequency of the difference between the other two tones.  For example, if you hear a 50Hz tone in the right ear and a 40Hz one in the left ear, the binaural beat has a 10Hz frequency. The brain tends to follow and synchronize with the binaural beat or isochronic tones, the Frequency Following Response (FFR).  5 main types of brain waves: :  Delta Brainwave : 0.1 Hz - 3 HZ, This will help you have better deep sleep.  Theta Brainwave : 4 Hz - 7 Hz, It contribute to improved meditation, creativity, and sleep in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase.  Alpha Brainwave : 8 Hz - 15 Hz, may encourage relaxation.  Beta Brainwave : 16 Hz - 30 Hz, This frequency range may help promote concentration and alertness.

This app is free, ad-free, and without data collection. Forever.  Life Notes is an app that allows you to record your chronic symptoms and lifestyle habits on a daily basis in order to monitor them, but also to potentially highlight some correlations.  It's possible to create your own symptom list in order to score them day after day, rating thef pain level intensity on a scale from 0 to 5.  It's also possible to record your meals, medications and add various notes, as well as your sleep schedules to highlight the causes of your symptoms. For example, it is easier to highlight the link between some of your meals and your possible stomach aches.  In addition to noting the daily evolution of the symptoms at different times of the day, it's also possible to enter an overall level of pain intensity over the course of a day in order to have a broader view of their evolution.  In short, Life-Notes offers what a simple notebook could do for you, but with a focus on tracking symptoms and providing statistics.

This is because sheer willpower is often too weak against deeply ingrained habits in the subconscious.

This technique helps dislodge limiting beliefs, lift any blockages, and remarkably strengthen your ability to take action. By working on your subconscious, you can slim down much more NATURALLY, easily and sustainably.  This exciting and effective 21-Day Program is designed by experts in hypnosis, neuroscience and nutrition.  FIRST BENEFITS: - Improve self-esteem / self-confidence - Remove limiting beliefs - Activate resilience - Fix the gut-brain connection - Heal from emotional eating - Reduce appetite - Strengthen motivation - Decrease cortisol - Accelerate metabolism ...

Just listen to the sessions comfortably. And if you usually weigh yourself, put the scale aside for now. Break out of usual routines, trust the process, let go, and simply enjoy the experience.

Do you find yourself losing weight then putting it back on again, again and again?  The problem with diets and short-term weight loss solutions is that, by definition, they're a change from the norm. Then, when you go back to 'normal life', the weight comes back on again.  A permanently healthy weight needs a permanently healthy mindset, which means a change in the way you relate to food. And this is where hypnosis comes in.  The free hypnosis session in the Weight Loss Hypnosis app from Uncommon Knowledge will firstly, relax you wonderfully deeply. Then it will work with your unconscious mind to change your attitude to food so that you start to desire what's good for you, instead of craving what's not.  With over 20 years experience, and more than 750,000 hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to get your unconscious mind on your side.  The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session.

Improve your Sleep With Meditation & Hypnosis  If you're looking for a way to improve your sleep, you may want to consider sleep meditation or hypnosis. Sleep hypnosis is a process of guiding your mind into a state of relaxation to fall asleep more easily. Hypnosis can be done with the help of the MindTastik sleep meditation app.  Sleep meditation involves focusing on your breath and letting go of all other thoughts. This can help to calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep. Both relax hypnosis and meditation can be done in bed just before sleep.  Self Hypnosis and Guided Meditation for Anxiety  For many of us, anxiety is a constant battle. Whether it's looming deadlines at work, upcoming social obligations, or simply the stresses of daily life, it can be tough to keep our anxiety under control. But there are some simple things we can do to help ease our anxiety and bring us back to a place of calm. One of those things is self-hypnosis, a form of meditation that helps us focus and relax our minds. By focusing on positive affirmations and breathing deeply, we can enter into a state of relaxation hypnosis which allows us to let go of our anxieties and fears.  Mindfulness is another great tool for managing anxiety and stress. By being present in the moment and focusing on our breath, we can learn to control our thoughts and let go of the stressors that are causing our anxiety.  Both relax hypnosis and mindfulness are excellent tools for managing anxiety.  ‚ñåTransform your life by using guided meditation, self-hypnosis, sleep sounds, and affirmations to eliminate negative thinking patterns from your subconscious. ‚ñåLearn mindfulness to get rid of intrusive thoughts and focus on the present moment. ‚ñåLearn new habits with our daily meditations or 7 days anxiety, sleep meditation, and relaxation challenges. The power of self-improvement lies in you! ‚ñåUse morning meditation, nature sounds, and our sleep sounds machine.  Relax and Sleep Well Hypnosis Meditate App by MindTastik  There are a lot of free calming apps out there, but there is a great reason for you to try MindTastik Meditation App. It will help you relax and sleep well, and it's also great for managing stress and anxiety. The app includes a variety of guided meditations, and you can choose from several different relaxation techniques. There are also some great visualizations that you can use to help you relax.

It can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as improve the overall quality of sleep. Through relaxation and visualization, hypnosis can help to relax the body and mind, making it easier to drift off to sleep. It can also help to quiet the mind and reduce intrusive thoughts, making it easier to stay asleep.   You can also use hypnosis for stopping smoking. During a hypnosis session for smoking cessation, the hypnotist will typically use relaxation and visualization techniques to help the person relax and focus. The hypnotist will then give positive suggestions to help the person become more aware of their smoking habits and their desire to quit. These suggestions can help to reduce the cravings and make quitting easier.   How to do self-hypnosis is possible by using relaxation and visualization techniques to help the person reach a state of focused attention. To start, make sure you are in a comfortable place and take some slow, deep breaths. Then, use visualization to imagine yourself in a relaxing place and focus on positive affirmations. Once you are in a relaxed state, you can then begin to make suggestions to yourself about the desired outcome. Our step by step video tutorials will help you to learn how to hypnotize in 5 minutes.   Hypnotherapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses hypnosis as a tool to help people make positive changes in their lives. Hypnotherapy can be used to treat a variety of issues, including anxiety, depression, phobias, and addiction. Hypnosis can be used to help with weight loss by addressing underlying psychological issues that may be contributing to overeating. Through hypnosis, a person can learn to become more aware of their eating habits, such as emotional eating, and become more in tune with their body's natural hunger and fullness cues. Additionally, hypnosis can help to reduce stress and increase motivation to make healthier lifestyle choices.

It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).   Details   Gain insights into your feelings  A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but Mood Patterns can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.   Capture how you feel in your daily life  Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries.  To capture all parts of your life that matter Mood Patterns uses a technique of the social sciences: ecological momentary assessment also known as experience sampling.   You are unique  Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With Mood Patterns, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.   Your data is yours  How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. Mood Patterns does not request Internet permission, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. Mood Patterns will not send us or anybody else your data.   Your data is safe  Denying Mood Patterns Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An app lock assures that only you can use your Mood Patterns app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is 256-bit AES encrypted. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.

Even before smartphones many of us use to write in a real diary witch many times was just a notepad in which we were writing down everything that we felt without worrying that we will be judged. Many of us, if not all, made our diary a secret diary just to be sure that no one reads it. Either is was a love diary or just a daily diary we loved it and share every emotion and thought. First crush, fight with your parents, first heartbreak, the time when you really felt in love ... all these moments were always shared with your dear diary.  Now, in our modern times, the simple old trusty journal notepad had become a application on our mobile device which allows us to do more in less time and very often in a more secure way. With that in mind we though to put our ideas, regarding to what WE believe a journal should be, in making a simple, intuitive and comprehensive diary application that will be your partner who listens but doesn't share anything that you think and feel.  To make it perfect for how we would like it to be we have included the following cool features:  A DIARY THAT IS SIMPLE, INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE - simplicity is the first thing in our minds  - easy and intuitive navigation between entries - calendar functionality that allows to navigate and filter trough your journal - possibility to add images on each entry - image gallery - all your intimate journal moments in one place - PDF export functionality for when you want to print or share your entries - search functionality - multiple settings that are easy to understand and use - overview on all log entries - simple design which make it easy to use - FREE diary will all functionality available  A SECRET DIARY NEEDS TO BE SAFE AND SECURED  - password protected - what used to be a physical journal with lock you now have a diary with password - auto lock functionality in case someone looks at your phone when your are not expecting - backup and restore functionality - whenever your need to change your phone or in case you lose it - complete reset and delete functionality - just in case you need to erase everything  STYLE & CUSTOMISATION - Make it feel like ""MY diary""  - emoji / emoticons stickers - share how you feel - can be used as a ""Mood Diary"" - multiple color styles - you need to make it personal and intimate - multiple fonts styles and font sizes - reminders - something that your old diary couldn't do  WORD CLOUD - Visualise your life, emotions and feelings in one place  - a place where most used words in your diary are displayed in one place in a beautiful way - allows you to filter your entries based on your most used words   Sentiments and feelings are part of our life and sharing them with someone or even for ourselves in a simple diary can make our life more enjoyable and pleasant. Reading what we've wrote in the past can help us understand who we are and what moments have defined our life. In a complex and always in a hurry world, writing down your precious moments in a intimate way in a intimate journal will always help you embrace the world in a beautiful and healthy way.  We hope you will find this application useful and will grow to love to use it."

Experience relaxation, learn to deal better with stress and intense emotions, cultivate self care and think more positively.  Mindfulness techniques include breathing exercises, meditation, the stress tracker, and much more, to develop good habits. Cultivating mindful living can also support therapy, e.g. for borderline or depression.  Mindfulness2go supports you with the following topics:  POSITIVE THINKING Targeted exercises direct your attention to the good things in your life. For example, with the exercise ""Positive sentence beginnings"", you direct your attention towards something positive in the middle of your day. End your day with a review of pleasant and helpful events. The exercise ""Three positive things"" supports you in doing that.   STRESS MANAGEMENT The ""Stress tracker"" supports you in noticing from time to time how stressed you are in the moment. Your stress level over time becomes a stress curve. Add notes to use this as your mood diary. This helps you understand what causes you stress, improves your self-awareness and thereby facilitates stress management. Breathing exercises such as ""Calm breathing"" provide you with islands of relaxation in a stressful day.   BEING MINDFUL IN EVERYDAY LIFE Mindfulness exercises for everyday life need very little time. Feeling the body, noticing your breath, seeing the good things, using all senses: discover a breadth of methods for being in the Here and Now. If you feel like challenging yourself, try ""Doing nothing"".   DEALING WITH INTENSE EMOTIONS Skills help you interrupt high stress. Before you freak out, these exercises take your mind off things, and you gain back some freedom to choose. Two examples: The little helper ""Stone in the shoe"" draws your focus towards your body perception ‚Äí away from strong, negative feelings. Use ""5-4-3-2-1"" to concentrate deliberately on things in the outside world. This way you distract yourself actively from overwhelming emotions.   MEDITATION Discover classic guided meditations as well as extra short meditations ""to go"" which only take a few minutes. For example, the ""Body scan"" is a classic mindfulness meditation ‚Äí a voyage through your body in the here and now. With the ""Mountain meditation"", you connect with two essential aspects: imperturbability and stability. A gong signals the beginning and end of every meditation.   SEEING THINGS MORE CLEARLY Reflections offer you a structure to think through some basic questions. This supports you in taking decisions, such as whether a situation needs acceptance or change. It can also help you investigate limiting beliefs and verify whether they are (still) accurate. For example: ""Journaling"" helps you sort out the topics that are important to you. That results in increased clarity. Behind stressful feelings, you can often discover important needs that are insufficiently met. The exercise ""Emotions and needs"" helps you understand them better.   Generally, the app can help you find more balance in a stressful life, reduce stress sustainably, and thereby prevent burnout. If you‚Äôd like, the ""Daily to go"" can provide you with a mindful inspiration at the start of every day. All aspects of the app are supported by concise and easy to read background knowledge articles. Some of the exercises are available free of charge. A subscription is needed to access the full set of exercises."

We aim to offer a far deeper approach to mindfulness than you‚Äôll find elsewhere‚Äîone that fundamentally transforms how you see yourself, and the world around you.  But you‚Äôll also discover life-changing, secular wisdom from top scholars and experts, on everything from sleep and doing good in the world to time management and happiness.  Waking Up is free for anyone who can‚Äôt afford it. We never want money to be the reason why someone can‚Äôt benefit from what we‚Äôve built.  **Created by Sam Harris Sam Harris, neuroscientist and best-selling author, built Waking Up to be the resource he wished he‚Äôd had when he began exploring meditation over 30 years ago.  Sam only includes those practices and insights he‚Äôs found to be utterly life-changing. The same is true for the many teachers, scholars, and experts you‚Äôll meet throughout the app.  **A step-by-step approach to mindfulness We‚Äôve heard from thousands of members who say they never really understood meditation until they took our 28-part Introductory Course.  Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or advanced practitioner, you‚Äôll dive straight into the deep end of real mindfulness, so you don‚Äôt waste any time on the surface.  **Learn the true purpose of meditation Meditation is about more than just relieving stress, sleeping better, or improving your focus. While it can help you do all of that, our goal is ultimately to help you open the door to a deeper understanding of yourself.  Here, you won‚Äôt just uncover simple relaxation techniques ‚Äîand you won‚Äôt find any New Age fluff or religious dogma.  **A place for serious seekers Explore some of life‚Äôs most important questions, on topics like neuroscience, psychedelics, enlightenment, ethics, and Stoicism‚Äîfrom renowned authors and professors like Oliver Burkeman, Michael Pollan, Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, James Clear, and others.  **In-depth theory and practice Waking Up explains both the theory and the practice of meditation ‚Äîso you don‚Äôt just learn the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of mindfulness, but also the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù  You‚Äôll be guided by prominent figures like Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, JayasƒÅra, and Henry Shukman, who teach a wide range of contemplative practices, including Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta, and more.  **Timeless insights, modern lens Within Waking Up, you‚Äôll find some of the most profound spiritual teachings from throughout history‚Äîthose that have stood the test of time. And you‚Äôll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.  But we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won‚Äôt find outlandish claims or anything we haven‚Äôt found to be empirically true.  **A comprehensive guide Waking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You‚Äôll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.  ‚ÄúWaking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I‚Äôve ever used.‚Äù Physician Peter Attia  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!‚Äù -Susan Cain, best-selling author  ‚ÄúWaking Up is not an app, it‚Äôs a path.

Talks  Listen and learn from the wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh and other Plum Village meditation teachers.  Ask Thay includes hundreds of real-life questions asked to the Zen Master, like ‚ÄúHow can we let go of anger? and ‚ÄúHow can I stop worrying?‚Äù His answers are compassionate and infused with insight.  Dharma Talks are teachings given by Thich Nhat Hanh and others on how to bring Buddhist wisdom and mindfulness into our life. Rather than discussing theoretical concepts, they focuses on direct and clear teachings to relieve suffering and create happiness in our day to day lives. Topics include depression, PTSD, relationships, sexual abuse, fear, and dealing with strong emotions.  Resources  In Resources you can find a library of daily practices, chants, poems, and songs. These bring to life the practices taught in Plum Village monasteries around the world and offer ways to bring mindfulness into our world, wherever we are.  Bell of Mindfulness  In Plum Village monasteries bells of mindfulness chime at regular intervals. Everybody stops and takes three mindful breaths to pause from their thinking or talking, breathe, and return to their bodies. The Bell of Mindfulness allows us to have the same reminder on our phone.  We can customize the bell to chime at different time periods.

The goal of meditation is the purification of the mind from restless and obsessive thoughts. There are two ways to meditate: meditation on the void and meditation through concentration. As an object of attention take a point on the wall, the fire of a candle or a painted image. It is important that attention is not distracted. When you feel fully focused, your thoughts will melt and you will enter a state of meditation.  The problem of beginners is that attention is difficult to keep at one point. You have to constantly remind yourself ‚Äúdo not get distracted!‚Äù And the state of meditation is lost.  This application allows you to set a sound reminder, so as not to be distracted. When you hear it, you will return to the point of concentration and the state of meditation will not be interrupted.  In the practice of meditation by concentration it is not necessary to sit in a particular position or in a particular place. This may be lying, standing, in bed or in transport. You can set the duration of the meditation yourself. Even 5, 10 minute meditation will increase awareness and give strength. Morning, daytime, evening (before bedtime) or even night meditation - the choice is yours!  There is no need to take meditation lessons - become a guru for yourself, and the application will be like a good helper.   The application is suitable for practitioners: Pranayama, Kundalini Yoga, Hatha, Kriya, Tantra, Bhakti, Karma, Jnana, Raja, Japa, Dhyana, Sahaja, Samadhi, Chakra Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Vipassana, Qigong, Affirmation, Zen, loving kindness (metta), meditation on the opening of the third eye, trataka, nada, visualization, presence meditation, sarguna, nirguna, fitness meditation.

See glossary of psychiatry.  Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination. Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used.[3] Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited and used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in 2013 which re-organized the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current research.[4]  The combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice,[5] but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. An inpatient may be treated in a psychiatric hospital. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis (e.g., with epidemiologists, mental health counselors, nurses, psychologists, public health specialists, radiologists or social workers).

Unlike meditation, it's fun, easy, and brings fast results. Try it out, and see the effects in as little as 8 minutes!  VOICE WILL HELP YOU - deal with anxiety and stress less - complete everyday tasks easier - get your sleep patterns back on track, sleep better and more deep - build confidence and self-esteem - deal with mood disorders and even mild depression - recover from caregiver burnout and emotional exhaustion - get unique motivational quotes and wallpapers - build personal development plan and enjoy life more  Mental health, just like physical health, is an essential part of a happy life. Voice can be your mental guide, a source of motivation, and an aid in making important life decisions.  You no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.   EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS  - Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.  - You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.   HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON  We like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.  Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.  Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.  For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again. You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.  Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.   BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES  Hypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.   HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS  - lower anxiety and stress levels - get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits - boost your energy - increase self-motivation - improve mental health  Meditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!

We believe the quality of your mindset determines the quality of your life. Our mission is to teach you to master your mindset so you can live your happiest life.  Trident Mindset teaches 12 proven tactics that will help you be calm, effective, and happy no matter what life throws at you: micro-goals, focus, breath control, intentionality, choosing the wrench, stoicism, discipline, meditation, mindfulness, flipping the script, self talk and visualization. Through concise daily lessons, practice exercises, and check-ins, you'll learn to master all 12 tactics.  The program begins with the Mindset 101 Course - a 12-day course that introduces you to 1 of the 12 mindset tactics each day.  Then you'll advance to the 12-month Mindset Mastery Course. Each month teaches you to master 1 of the 12 tactics. Each day of the month includes a 5-minute lesson, practice exercise, and check-in that teaches you something new about that month's tactic. We spend a month on each tactic, so you have time to turn the tactic into a lasting habit before you move on to the next one.  We believe life should be spent being happy. But it can be hard to find happiness amidst all the adversity and challenge we face in life. In our careers, we were fortunate to learn a set of tactics that helped us be calm, effective, and happy no matter what was going on. These tactics proved themselves in the laboratory, on the battlefield, and everywhere in between. Learning these tactics changed our lives profoundly, so we're now dedicating our lives to teaching them to everyone.  By learning to master our mindsets, we can all learn to be calm, effective, and happy in every moment rather than only when things are going well. We hope you'll join us.

How it started: Positive Mental Training was first used within the NHS for patients with low mood, stress and depression and we soon found that it was also being used by the doctors and nurses for their own benefit too. It can help with all life stresses, including burnout and sleep problems.  The tracks in Sorted began with the 12 track Positive Mental Training audio CDs, when Dr Alastair Dobbin, a GP and Dr Sheila Ross, a ancadapted a Swedish Olympic Sports performance programme, drawn to its positive self-development focus. Since then research has demonstrated its ability to build good psychological functioning, as well as recovery from depression and anxiety. The App is used within the NHS by staff and patients, in many colleges and universities for staff and students and recommended in Public Health England ‚ÄòEvery Mind Matters‚Äô campaign, for NHS health and social care staff across Scotland.  We are working on making the Sorted mental health app as accessible as possible so everyone can use the app. Our accessibility statement: https://www.sortedmentalhealth.app/feeling-good-app-accessibility-statement/	Jul 10, 2025		0.9352270651						Round A	Mental Health	Mental Health	Soothing Audio, Meditation	General		Anxiety, Depression & Mood Disorders		False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

Psy interactive is a groundbreaking application helping the therapist to fully collect organize and process all patient‚Äôs data including:  A complete Clinical Interview (Demographics, Previous interventions, Significant others, Medical history, Jobs, Studies, Residences, Standards of living, Interests/Activities, Moral values, Sexual life, Families, Childhood history). Clinical Picture (both therapists and patients point of view). Reason for visiting. State of emergency record. During the treatment process the therapist collects, and can easily access with only a click:  Cognitive Map (Early experiences, Rules/Assumptions/Statements, Core beliefs, Defence Mechanisms, Cognitive Distortions) Requests of patient, Symptoms, Life events (by category), Diagnoses, Goals development, Psychoeducation, Interventions, Relapse prevention, Techniques & worksheets used during therapy. All of the above are well organized, fully connected and easily accessible with just a click.  But even more, Psy interactive implements some groundbreaking new views and tools like ‚Äúlife timeline‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal statistics‚Äù graphs, providing valuable information in real time during the therapeutic process. Just try the timeline, where on a single graph you can see all the life events of the patient and extract valuable conclusions regarding interactions and influences.  Techniques & worksheets are posing a great role during therapy. At this end, we provide more than a hundred pre-loaded Techniques & Worksheets at the therapists service. Even more, using the embedded ‚ÄúTechniques generator‚Äù the therapist can either customize the provided techniques, or compose completely new ones!  While Psy interactive (therapist) works perfectly as a standalone application, its full power is unleashed when it is used in conjunction with Psy interactive (patient).  At any stage of the treatment process, the therapist can easily send via encrypted email one or more of the techniques forms to his patient. The patient receives the technique into his Psy interactive (patient) app, fills in the form, and returns it to the therapist before the next session. Everything is kept organized and is been filed appropriately. A copy of the technique is kept into both the therapist and patient applications.  Just imagine how much will it help you, to prepare the next session, when you will have the filled technique or worksheet a day or two before the upcoming session!  Last but not least, the embedded calendar will help you organize your sessions. Sessions can also be send to the patient via email.  In the mobile era, all of us in applicality we choose to transform the way psychotherapy is performed, and implement interaction via technology. All these just in your palm, accessible even when you are on the move.

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.  DRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION  Check the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.  KnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.  DRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS  Search for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).  Drug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.  If you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.  HARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE  Harm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.  KnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.  KNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU TO:  - learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival - find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.

Obsessions and compulsions are often distressing, time-consuming, and impairing.  Everyone has worried about germs or losing something or someone getting hurt. These thoughts tend to be fleeting and do not disrupt daily living. If these thoughts are constantly occurring, uncontrollable, intrusive, and cause a lot of anxiety or stress, then they may be considered 'obsessions.'  Everyone has felt the need to double check that the door is locked or arrange items in a correct way. If you perform these actions like a ritual or with rigid rules in order to prevent or reduce anxious thoughts, or if these actions greatly disrupt your life, then they may be considered 'compulsions.'  This app is designed to evaluate your symptoms of OCD with a scientifically-supported 18-question test. It uses the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), a screening questionnaire for OCD that is commonly used in research and healthcare settings. The OCI-R is also helpful for monitoring your OCD-related symptoms during and after treatment.  OCD Test contains four tools: - Start Test: take the OCI-R questionnaire to assess OCD symptoms - History: see a history of your test scores to monitor your symptoms over time - Information: learn about OCD and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery - Reminder: set up notifications to re-take the questionnaire at your convenience  Disclaimer: The OCI-R is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. Please consult a physician or mental health professional if you are concerned about OCD.¬†  References: Foa, E.

The module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.  The module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only ‚Äì switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚Äöbox breathing‚Äò technique‚Äì full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.  Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)  The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).  The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‚Äòs life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.  In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again ‚Äì the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.  In the last module ‚Äì PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES ‚Äì there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.

WHY USE THERAPEER? You're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment. Yes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it. Yes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don‚Äôt always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too. Yes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don‚Äôt want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that. But most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.  We get all of that. We get YOU.   HOW DOES IT WORK? ‚Ä¢ Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need. ‚Ä¢ Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately). ‚Ä¢ After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing.

Find out from our extensive list of Phobias, the inner fears that have been troubling you all these years. Maybe you hate spiders or large crowds ,find out what Phobia you have.  Phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.  Specific phobias should be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves. Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with some combination of counselling and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.  What happens when your fears begin to take over? Fear can control your life and keep you from following your dreams, prevent you from taking risks, and stop you from living the life that you want and doing the things which you desire.  * Features:  - No internet connection required - With SEARCH function - Simple user interface. - Psychological conditions. - Animal phobias. - Non-psychological conditions.

It is impossible for you to get from life what you really desire when you aren't willing to do what it takes to know how to overcome fear of being successful. There are times that you think you are almost touching happiness and holding it tightly, but you can't be sure enough how to overcome fear. When this kind of fear is strong, some sort of negative feeling is coming your way that doesn't allow you to let go things which would be able to accelerate your path to success.  The fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there.  Break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous.

Mental health professionals in private or group practices can use PsychSurveys to administer customizable diary cards/tracking sheets as well as valid and reliable mental health surveys to their patients to measure distress levels and track patient progress over time. PsychSurveys was developed in partnership with psychologists who are intensively trained in cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies. It improves client care by allowing you to objectively measure your clients' symptoms and use the results to highlight progress or identify areas needing further intervention.  Simply choose which survey(s) you wish to have your patient(s) complete and how often. Patients can use either the mobile app for alerts and completion of surveys at home or while in session, or they can receive email alerts with links to complete surveys using a web browser on a PC or mobile device. Patients can opt out of the email alerts at any time simply by clicking the link in the email to opt out.  If patients use the mobile app, they'll see reminders and alerts on their iPhone or iPad when surveys are due and a badge icon indicating how many surveys are due.  As surveys are completed, they are automatically scored. Each patient's progress is tracked over time for each applicable survey. The reports include all relevant scales and sub-scales and you can drill down to see how the patient responded to the questions in the surveys for each time they completed a survey.  We offer 150 pre-configured surveys:  Anxiety: AAI, AAQ-OC, ASQ-2, ATSS, BDD-YBOCS, CAPS, CY-BOCS, DASS-21, DOCS, FASA, GAD-2, GAD-7, HAI-18, ITQ, ITQ-CA, K-GSADS-A, LSAS, MGH-HPS, Mini-SPIN, MIST-A, OASIS, OCI-4, OCI-12, OCI-R, OBQ-44, PCL-5, PCL-Child, PCL-Civilian, PDSS-SR, PSS-I-5, PSWQ, PSWQ-C, PTCI, SCARED-C, SCARED-P, SCI-R, SI-R, SIAS, SMSP-A, SMSP-C, SOCS, SPIS, SPIN, SPOVI, SPS-R, TRS, TSC-C, TSC-P, Y-BOCS, ZSAS  Borderline Personality Disorder: BEST, BSL-23, DBT-WCCL, ISAS, LPI, MSI-BPD, BPFSC-11  Relationship Satisfaction: BARE, CSI  Mood Disorders: ATQ, BADS-SF, BDI, BRFL-A, BRFL-12, CES-DC, CORE-10, DAS-SF1, DAS-SF2, DASS-21, DSRS-C, EPDS, GDS, PHQ-2, PHQ-9, PHQ-A, QIDS-SR16, RRS-SF-10, USSIS, WSAS, WSASY, ZSDS  Eating Disorders: ED-15, EDE-Q, EDE-QS, EDQOL, IES-2, PVA, SCOFF, YFAS  Emotion Dysregulation: AAQ-2, ASRM, DERS, DERS-18  Substance Abuse: AUDIT, BAM, DrInC, InDUC-M, SDS, SIP-R, URICA  Therapeutic Relationship: CALPAS-P, CHS, HAq-II, MHCS  Clinician Surveys: EBPPAS, ProQOL  Others: 6-PAQ, AAQ, ADNM-20, AEX, AHS, ASRS, B-MEAQ, Brief COPE, BRS, C-SSRS, CFQ, DAR-5, DES-II, DHEQ, FAD, FFMQ-15, FMPS, FMPS-B, FS, IPS, ISI, MHC-SF, PANAS-C, PANAS-C-P, PBQ, PBQ-SF, PNS, PQ-LES-Q, PSC, PSQI, PSS, Psy-Flex, PTQ, Q-LES-Q-SF, SAPAS, SCS, SMQ, SRAS-R, SRM, SRQ, SSQ, UPPS-P, VADRS-P, VQ, Y-PSC  Diary Cards are a tool to help patients track emotions, urges, and behaviors on a daily basis. This aids clinicians in identifying their patients areas of struggle over the course of the week to more effectively prioritize session time and identify points for intervention. The diary card also functions as a tool for increasing awareness of emotions and urges for clients, as well as helping them identify Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills they could use in moments of distress. When patients complete Diary Cards, the results are available for viewing instantly. There is no need for patients to email their diary cards to you each week. This feature is fully customizable and could be used as tracking sheets focusing on emotions, urges, and behaviors for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) based interventions as well.  With PsychSurveys, patients do not need to email you their results from surveys and diary cards - the results are available to you in real-time automatically. In addition, setting up surveys and diary cards for patients is quick, simple, and centralized.

The medical condition was previously known as manic depression, and it is estimated that around 3% of the world's population over the age of 18 may be affected at some point in their life cycle.  The causes of bipolar disorder are diverse and not completely known, although it is estimated that the predisposition to bipolarity is largely inherited through genetics, and can be triggered throughout life by factors such as stress, pregnancy and the use of illicit drugs.  Typical treatment for Bipolar Disorder includes medications prescribed by a psychiatrist, psychological therapies, counseling, and education for family and friends.  Although there is no cure for the condition, with proper treatment it can be brought under control and affected individuals are usually able to work, have families and participate in all aspects of community life.  Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder is not an easy task, since it can be confused or present together with other psychological conditions of different course and severity, which makes it essential to go to a mental health professional to obtain a reliable diagnosis and beyond any doubt.   The TABS Bipolar Scale  The Triaxial Bipolar Spectrum Scale (TABS) was developed by Dr. Greg Mulhauser as a tool to help raise awareness of experiences that might be indicative of bipolar disorder in people over the age of 18.  It differs from other bipolar screening tools that can be found on the Internet by explicitly checking for factors that exclude a possible diagnosis, therefore its results may differ radically from those offered by older online tests.  At Psicopedia we have adapted the TABS Scale with the intention of providing a tool for exclusively personal and educational use, which in no case can replace the assessment carried out by a qualified professional in an appropriate clinical context.  It is important to clarify that the results of this test have not been compared with other structured tools (such as the SCID, for example) for the evaluation of validity in terms of sensitivity and specificity.  Therefore, this instrument should not be used to make a diagnosis, but only as a tool aimed at recognizing personal experiences that could suggest a bipolar spectrum disorder.

This application was made by me to help other parents of children with ASD and professionals dealing with autistic children. The application is based on the ATEC test from the American Autism Research Institute. It is designed for children from 5 to 12 years.  But you can pass the test for children 3-4 years old before visiting a doctor and getting an official diagnosis to dispel or confirm your fears. --- If a child is younger than 3 years old, the test is strictly irrelevant. For children from one and a half to three years, use the quick test M-CHAT-R: https://www.autismspeaks.org/screen-your-child --- How does the test work?  The test is used to assess the dynamics of improvements in children with autism or also for initial testing of children who may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Basically, the lower the score, the fewer the problems.  Thus, if a person scores a '20' on one day, and then a '15' two weeks later, then the individual showed improvement. In contrast, if the score was '30', then the individual's behavior worsened.  For more correct scores, it is better if different people in contact with the child take the test. For example, if on the same day dad, mom, and specialist in the rehabilitation center give different answers, you will get a different number of points. The application will calculate the average score on that day and show it on the chart. --- Warning! The ATEC test is not a medical diagnostic test! The application is not intended to set the diagnosis. It basically provides several subscale scores as well as a total score to be used for comparison at a later date.  If you have scored more than 30 points, you should contact a specialist to make a survey and precise diagnosis.

PMR is a - scientifically proven - very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:  ‚Ä¢ tensions ‚Ä¢ migraine or headache ‚Ä¢ inner unrest ‚Ä¢ sleep disorders ‚Ä¢ back pain / pain ‚Ä¢ states of excitement, ‚Ä¢ anxiety and panic attacks ‚Ä¢ high blood pressure ‚Ä¢ psychosomatic complaints ‚Ä¢ burnout ‚Ä¢ stress and much more  With regular practice, you will always find it easier to get into deeper states of relaxation. Once you have enough practice with the long form of PMR (Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups), you can switch to the short forms with 7 and 4 muscle groups and finally to the Mental form: Body Scan. Then you can relax your body even mentally.  ALL COMMON 4 FORMS OF PMR ‚Ä¢ Basic Form (17 muscle groups) ‚Ä¢ Short Form I (7 muscle groups) ‚Ä¢ Short Form II (4 muscle groups) ‚Ä¢ Mental Form (Body Scan) for Beginner, Advanced and Experienced are taught and practiced in this app.  BASIC FORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS 1. Right hand and forearm 2. Right upper arm 3. Left hand and forearm 4. Left upper arm 5. Forehead 6. Upper cheek part and nose 7. Lower cheek part and jaw 8. Neck 9. Chest, shoulders and upper back 10. Abdominal 11. Buttocks and pelvic floor 12. Right thigh 13. Right lower leg 14. Right foot 15, 16, 17 (-> left side)  SHORT FORM I: 7 MUSCLE GROUPS 1. Right hand, forearm, and upper arm 2. Left hand, forearm and upper arm 3. Forehead, cheek part, nose and jaw 4. Neck 5. Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor 6. Right thigh, lower leg and foot 7. Left thigh, lower leg, and foot  SHORT FORM II: 4 MUSCLE GROUPS 1. Both hands, forearms and upper arms 2. Face and neck 3. Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor 4. Both thighs, lower legs and feet  MENTAL FORM: BODY SCAN Guided relaxation through the whole body, starting from the head to the feet. This guide is the last stage of the PMR, in which the perception is directed to individual parts of the body without tensing them. The relaxation is now only mental. Soothing imaginations will help you.  MUSIC TRACKS & NATURE SOUNDS For all exercises, you can select among 5 relaxation music tracks and 22 nature sounds. The volume can be adjusted individually. If desired, the music & sounds can also be used without voice to relax or fall asleep.  FOR SLEEPING OR RELAXING All exercises can be used to fall asleep or to relax.  DURATION OF TENSION & PAUSES FOR RELAXATION Set your preferred duration of tension and relaxation between the muscle groups.  TIMER FUNCTION After the end of the exercise an unlimited time for the music / sounds can be set so that the soft music / sounds will deepen your relaxation.

Watch any time, any place to de-stress and re-balance within just a few minutes. Or settle down and enjoy a whole series for a deeply immersive and transformational experience.  Syntropy is perfect for both the newcomer and those more experienced at relaxation, breathwork and meditation. The evolving art absorbs your mind and the rhythmic music calms your emotions. Syntropy is a uniquely different and pleasurable way to achieve optimal states.  Syntropy is a collaborative project. We commission art and music from a diverse selection of emerging and established artists from all over the world. We‚Äôre passionate about empowering artists and musicians to play their part in helping to heal our stressed, anxious and unhappy society - art and music are powerful medicines! And we‚Äôre proud to promote Syntropy‚Äôs artists too. We feature them in profiles on our website and we produce interviews with them too, allowing the viewers of their art and music to learn more about them, their creative processes and why they are dedicated to creating art and music for wellbeing.  About the app: You will have full access to several galleries of amazing video artworks. These are organized into 3 categories - Breathe, Relax and Elevate. Breathe features sublime video artworks for coherence breathwork, each available in either 8, 10 or 12 second breath cycles to suit all preferences. Relax features calming, transcendent abstract visuals and divine soundscapes which you can simply lose yourself in or, if you prefer, use for breathwork or focused attention meditation. Elevate features uplifting and stimulating vibes and visuals to elevate your mood and energy - perfect if you‚Äôre feeling a bit low.  Every Monday we feature a Breathe, Relax or Elevate video from our international digital artists and musicians;  All of our videos are presented in both dark and light modes for enjoyment at any time of day or night. You do need a good internet or mobile signal to play the videos but using our download feature means that you can also enjoy videos whenever you are offline - perfect for traveling or those times when you can‚Äôt get a good signal for streaming.  Where art meets science: Syntropy is so effective because it blends art with science. Geometric, abstract and psychedelic art bypasses the brain‚Äôs perceptual networks associated with stored ‚Äúknown‚Äù information. When you look at this type of art you don‚Äôt see familiar objects that the brain can make sense of; rather, you see beautifully unusual, complex and evolving shapes which defy meaning. In bypassing the known, you open yourself up to the unknown and unconscious. Mandalas and geometries can also lead the brain into Alpha brainwaves and promote open focus and feelings of calm and positivity.  The breathing pacers help you to breathe slowly, deeply and in balance. This type of breathing creates a state called psychophysiological coherence which has various benefits for both the body and brain including improved homeostasis, increased vagal tone and optimal cognitive function. In addition to the beautiful visuals, calming music can also induce psychophysiological changes which reduce stress and anxiety and improve relaxation and mood.  Like the sound of Syntropy? Why not try it free of charge for 7 days? You‚Äôll only be charged after the 30 days and you can cancel any time up until then.  Why did we choose the name Syntropy? Syntropy means the emergence of order from chaos - and that‚Äôs exactly what our app helps you to achieve!

Lo√≥na is the first app that lets you take care of your mind and body wellness with the help of interactive coloring sessions, breathing exercises, relax melodies, positive affirmations, meditation, relaxing sleep games, sleep music and bedtime stories, all accompanied by soothing relax melodies including nature sounds, white noise, pink noise and brown noise to get you in the right mood to fall asleep soundly to relaxing music and beat anxiety and insomnia.  Features of Loona: - Sleep Games - Sleep Stories - Bedtime Stories - Music & Nature Sounds, Playlists  SO, IT'S ANOTHER APP TO HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP FAST, RIGHT? Not exactly. Lo√≥na isn‚Äôt a list of direct ""go-to-sleep"" techniques that beats insomnia, but rather a soothing pod, a sleep aid or mood-altering app. Stay calm and relieve anxiety during the day by listening to ocean waves, wind sounds, and other relax melodies and prepare yourself to fall asleep easily in the evening with the help of sleepscape, bedtime stories, sleep music and coloring, soothing sounds and calming sleep games.  WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT? Negative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future making it hard to fall asleep. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood to sleep well.  HOW DOES LO√ìNA WORK? From the wake up and during the busy day Lo√≥na will support your emotional states with playlists and calming immersive stories. Each night you‚Äôll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that bundles together CBT, activity-based relaxation, storytelling, sleep meditation and sleep sounds and sleep music uniquely. Complete it by stepping into the soothing pod to shut the frantic world out, relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood. Complete it by stepping into the soothing pod to shut the frantic world out, relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep. Focus on calming activities to stop ruminating and quiet your racing thoughts.  DOES IT BEAT INSOMNIA? 87% of Lo√≥na users reported improvement in sleep quality after 14 days of use. Escape sessions help users beat insomnia and fall asleep fast.   IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP MEDITATION or SLEEP APP? Mastering sleep meditation techniques requires a lot of patience and time. Starting your Lo√≥na journey is as easy as playing a relaxing sleep game for just 15 minutes a day.  CAN I USE A PHONE BEFORE BED? Lo√≥na uses dimmer, warmer colors that are less likely to suppress melatonin. While the session of coloring itself has been shown to have a calming effect and can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can also improve sleep quality and eventually beat insomnia.  Incorporating Lo√≥na into a bedtime routine helps decrease time spent on scrolling social networks. Because scrolling social networks before bedtime exposes you to bright screens and blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and interfere with your sleep-wake cycle.  What do you get: - 70+ interactive sleepscape journeys and relaxing & bedtime games for sleeping - immersive bedtime stories for adults - calm down or focus with relax melodies & bedtime stories - soothing sleep sounds like nature sounds including rain sounds and ocean waves, wind, brown noise or white noise and for tinnitus relief - lullabies to help you put your kids to bed - breathing exercises - gentle alarm clock - affirmations, motivational quotes and sleep meditation - bedtime games  Terms of service: http://loona.app/terms Privacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"	Apr 3, 2024		0.3323390492						Round A	Mental Health	Mental Health	Meditation, Soothing Audio, Other	General		Sleep, Anxiety, General		False	False	False	False	False	True	False	True	True	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

We recommend brown noise for sleep, and it's also great for focus and meditation.  ‚Ä¢ Green Noise has a natural feel, like the ambient sound of a forest. Green noise is versatile, useful for both sleep and focus.  ‚Ä¢ Pink Noise is balanced like rain sounds. We recommend pink noise for sleep and focus.  ‚Ä¢ White Noise is flat and crisp, like a cascading waterfall. White noise can help mask high-pitched tinnitus.  Do you struggle to sleep at night because of distracting sounds like traffic or a partner snoring? Noise Machine's sleep sounds mask these noises and help you sleep naturally. Brown noise and green noise are particularly effective sleep sounds. White noise can help with tinnitus management during sleep.  Noise Machine helps focus your mind in distracting environments. By replacing disruptive sounds with white noise, green noise, brown noise, or pink noise, the distractions are drowned out, leaving you in virtual silence. The noises calm and relax the mind, allowing you to focus and improve productivity. Try green noise and white noise for effective focus sounds.

When I want help sleeping, I find myself turning to Slumber only. Their narrators are more skilled in the relaxing & soothing style of speaking. You don't need celebrities; you need people with calming, wonderful voices who know how to read in a hypnotherapy-style cadence. And Slumber has better sleep sound options, and you have more control over those options. I also like that you can choose to keep playing the background noise, and perhaps a sound like rain, for a set amount of time after the narration ends. Also‚Äî better calm stories designed for relaxing, comforting sleep too! Plus, the price is better.  -- Cafegirl2009, App Store Review   Curing insomnia is not only about sounds to help you sleep. Sleeping meditation, audio bedtime stories, calming stories for sleep & other sleep aids can also help. Our goal is to help you get a good sleep at night.

These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.  Sleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.  üìà- Get Your Sleep Score Sleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better.

Does self consciousness sometimes stop you forming deep connections with people?  Social anxiety or social phobia can be crippling. When so much of life depends on being able to interact freely with others, social anxiety can block your development in many different areas.  We know that introverts suffer most from social anxiety, but it's rarely discussed why this would be when, in fact, it's quite simple. In social situations, most of the time you want your attention to be focused outwards, onto other people. Introverts tend to have powerful imaginations, which can grab the attention and focus it inwards. Feelings of anxiety then turn the imagination in an unhelpful direction.  The trick is to lower anxiety so that the ebb and flow of attention can be managed more artfully, in which case the imagination can be a wonderful aid to socialising. The reason hypnosis can be so effective for social anxiety is that, more than anything else, hypnosis is the artful management of the attention.  The free hypnosis session in the Social Anxiety Hypnotherapy app from Uncommon Knowledge will firstly, relax you wonderfully deeply. Then it will work with your unconscious mind to change your response to social situations.  During the hypnosis sessions in the app, your attention will be guided to experiences that are enjoyable and beneficial, in preparation for real life social experiences. Then, when a real life social situation occurs, your mind and emotions will be ready and 'trained' in how to respond with relaxation, playfulness and outwardly focused attention.  With over 20 years experience, and more than 750,000 hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to get your unconscious mind on your side.  The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session. You can use that for as long as you like, but if you want more variety at any time you can upgrade to the monthly paid option and access 10 more social anxiety sessions.  On of our popular sessions 'Overcome Self Consciousness' is free inside the app to get you started right away. Then, if you like what you hear, you can unlock the other sessions with the monthly payment option.  From Uncommon Knowledge, delivering hypnosis since 1998.   # CONTENTS #   # Free:  ‚Ä¢ Overcome Self Consciousness   # Paid:  ‚Ä¢ Be Yourself Socially ‚Ä¢ Overcoming Shyness ‚Ä¢ Self Confidence Booster ‚Ä¢ Speaking in Groups ‚Ä¢ Socializing Motivation ‚Ä¢ Increase Your Social Circle ‚Ä¢ Making Small Talk ‚Ä¢ Fear of Being Judged ‚Ä¢ Care Less What Others Think ‚Ä¢ Conversation Starter  # Pricing  Hypnosis for Social Anxiety offers an auto-renewing subscription option at $4.99/month.

Most people who experience traumatic events may have difficulty adjusting at first but eventually get back to their normal routines. If you continue to feel distressed long after the traumatic event has occurred, you may have PTSD.  This app is designed to evaluate your symptoms of PTSD with a scientifically-supported 20-question screening test. It uses the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a screening questionnaire for PTSD that is often used in healthcare and research settings. The PCL-5 is also helpful for monitoring your PTSD-related symptoms during and after treatment.  PTSD Test contains four tools: - Start Test: take the PCL-5 to assess your PTSD symptoms - History: see a history of your test scores to monitor your symptoms over time - Information: learn about PTSD and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery - Reminder: set up notifications to re-take the test at your convenience  Disclaimer: The PCL-5 is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional.

With the right strategies and techniques, PTSD can be beaten, which has been proven by decades of research and the Trauma Brace founder‚Äôs personal experience overcoming trauma. Hopefully, Brace can teach you how to heal. Just like with traditional therapy, the exercises can be tough, but the more you put in, the more you can get out!  ** What is Brace? ** Brace is a full, end-to-end program for people who are struggling after a trauma. You do not need to have a therapist to use Brace, and you do not need to have an official PTSD diagnosis. Regardless of your trauma type, or whether you are a soldier or civilian, Brace was designed with you in mind. It is based on techniques that have been studied for decades and are proven to help reduce symptoms after a trauma. Brace makes these techniques available in a self-help format by providing instructions, help and tracking as you progress through the exercises and make your way to graduation, which typically takes about 5 sessions per week for 9-12 weeks. In a clinical setting, the majority of PTSD patients who follow these same steps see a significant reduction in symptoms.  Brace was developed by a PTSD survivor who wanted to make this knowledge more accessible and affordable for other sufferers. This type of therapy typically costs $7,000+ but full access to Brace is less than 1% of that. Brace will start with an assessment that can help you understand how severe your symptoms are and whether or not the full program might be a good fit. Only once you see your score and complete the free introduction will you be asked to decide if you‚Äôd like to pay to continue with the full program.  ** Who is it for? ** Brace is for anyone struggling after experiencing something traumatic. Some examples are: - Combat - Assault - Terrorism - Severe accident - Loss of loved one - Abuse - Life-threatening illness - Healthcare maltreatment - Natural disasters ‚Ä¶and more  If after the trauma you‚Äôve been experiencing some of the following symptoms, you might need help processing what happened: - Nightmares - Insomnia - Flashbacks - Panic attacks - Physiological response (high heart rate, heavy breathing) - Hyper-vigilance, or feeling super alert - Irritability or outbursts - Feeling cut off from people or activities you used to love - Difficulty concentrating - Lack of intimacy - Feeling detached or unable to experience positive emotion - Overwhelming guilt or shame - Self-destructive behaviors ‚Ä¶and more  --- This is not a healthcare app and it does not provide medical advice. This is a self-help system that can be used to improve wellbeing. Any advice received by a medical professional supersedes anything seen in this app. The app can not provide any official diagnoses as that can only be done by healthcare professionals at this time. ---	Aug 28, 2024		0.682692746						Round B	Mental Health	Mental Health	Talk Therapy / Coaching - AI/Digital, Educational Content	General		Trauma / PTSD		False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
