"The Hero's Journey program will help you become more emotionally stable, conquer the challenges in your life, and achieve your goals! Unlike meditation, it's fun, easy, and brings fast results. Try it out, and see the effects in as little as 8 minutes!

VOICE WILL HELP YOU
- deal with anxiety and stress less
- complete everyday tasks easier
- get your sleep patterns back on track, sleep better and more deep
- build confidence and self-esteem
- deal with mood disorders and even mild depression
- recover from caregiver burnout and emotional exhaustion
- get unique motivational quotes and wallpapers

Mental health, just like physical health, is an essential part of a happy life. Voice can be your mental guide, a source of motivation, and an aid in making important life decisions.

You no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.


EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS

- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.

- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.


HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON

We like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.

Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.

Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.

For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.
You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.

Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.


BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES

Hypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.


HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS

- lower anxiety and stress levels
- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits
- boost your energy
- increase self-motivation
- improve mental health

Meditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!

Their path led them to a serene retreat in Thailand, where the wisdom of a monk/coach introduced them to the power of journaling, meditation, and living in the moment. This pivotal experience ignited a profound realization: the life-changing benefits of personal coaching, a privilege once reserved for elite athletes, should be accessible to everyone.
Inspired to bridge this gap, they, together with their friend Bhartesh, founded Wellness Coach. With a mission to make wellness readily accessible for all, Wellness Coach offers a comprehensive suite of mental and physical health services, from multilingual digital health resources to personalized coaching and clinical solutions. It's more than a company; it's a movement to empower individuals to navigate life's challenges with grace and resilience, inspired by the founders' own journey toward healing and growth.

-D, Julie and Bhartesh.

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind.

It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout?

üìà View your phone usage, and take control of your time.
‚è≥ Limit app and website usage. Set hourly or daily usage limits.
üìä Get weekly usage reports. View trends in your digital wellbeing.
üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Strict blocking: can be enabled to become even more productive.

üí™ Boost your productivity, stay focused, and improve your digital wellbeing!
Block is an easy-to-use Android application that improves your self-control by blocking or limiting your app usage and giving you insight into how your time is spent on your phone. Whether you need to focus on your üéì study, don't want to get distracted at üíº work, can't go to üõå sleep at night, or want to be more üë• social, this app can help you out.


üïì BLOCK SPECIFIC APPS AT SPECIFIC TIMES
Select a group of apps and create a custom time schedule during which these apps will automatically be blocked. The schedule is fully customizable, allowing you to set different times on different days in the week, allowing you to create productive habits. An active block cannot be turned off so that it prevents you from using distracting apps.
‚è±Ô∏è You can temporarily activate your blocks at any time for a specific duration. Great for when you start a study session or want to go to sleep. Often combined with a Pomodoro timer for increased productivity.

üìä VIEW APP USAGE
You can analyze your phone usage over different time periods, going back up to 2 years. See where your time is spent and take steps to improve your digital wellbeing.

‚åõ SET HOURLY/DAILY USAGE LIMITS
Wasting time on social media, or watching too many YouTube videos? You can configure an hourly/daily usage limit for specific apps. When you reach the time limit, the apps will be blocked for the remainder of the day. The limits are customizable per day of the week. For example, detox from Facebook and other social media apps by only allowing 30 minutes per weekday, limit Reddit to 20 minutes in the weekend, or block Whatsapp after 1 hour of messaging.

üìà RECEIVE WEEKLY USAGE REPORTS
At the start of each week, you will receive an overview of your app usage of the week before. This contains a detailed breakdown of where your time was spent during the week, allowing you to easily decide which apps to restrict. You will be able to have more quality time and reduce your phone addiction, resulting in a better digital diet.

üîí STRICT APP BLOCKING
Strictness of each block can be configured, when strict mode is enabled you cannot pause or edit an active restriction, except by rebooting your phone. If that is too easy, you can even prevent a reboot from disabling active blocks in the app's settings. This app uses the Device Administrator permission. The permission can (optionally) be enabled inside the app's settings to prevent the app from being force closed or uninstalled, such that there is no way to circumvent a block. Procrastinators, this app is made for you.

OTHER
Additionally, you can place widgets on your home screen that allow you to start a block in a single tap. There is Tasker support to automate the starting of a block at any time.

PRIVACY
This app uses a number of special permissions, like an Accessibility service, to detect and block app and website usage. No personal information or app usage data is collected from these permissions, all data stays on your phone.

SUPPORT

2. Monitoring: space designed to monitor your emotions, energy, hours of sleep and time of physical activity. Realizing and recording daily how your emotions vary over the days is the first step in overcoming your symptoms. From there, you will be able to identify the circumstances and thoughts related to your emotions.
3. Behavioral Activation: Select pleasurable activities from a wide list of suggestions, planning a weekly schedule with your favorite activities and monitoring your emotions regarding your behaviors. You can customize your activities according to your interests and skills, balancing fun activities with activities of responsibility and personal fulfillment. This strategy is of recognized importance in the treatment of depression;
4. Thoughts: record and question your thoughts. This technique, known as cognitive restructuring, will help you to identify possible distortions of thoughts, making it possible to question them and insert more functional mental schemes, appropriate with reality data. This will contribute to the relief of unpleasant emotions, as you will perceive your experiences in a more functional and adaptive way;
5. Tools: you will have access to several other strategies to experience your emotions, including diaphragmatic breathing exercise, muscle relaxation, coping cards, anti-procrastination exercise, gratitude diary, among others. Also, you can count on scales of symptom assessment that will assist in monitoring your progress.

The search for a psychologist or psychiatrist is not always accessible to everyone. Specialized professionals may not be available in your region, may be expensive, or you may not be motivated to undergo therapy. Thinking about it, the psychiatrist Dr. Ives Cavalcante Passos, and the psychologists Dra. Analysis de Souza Vivan and Dra. Daniela Tusi Braga got together to develop the most complete application you will find to fight depression. This is a highly qualified team, with important academic and clinical performance. You are not alone on this journey! We care about you and will be on the other side of the screen, monitoring and assisting you in your evolution.

The most suitable cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques are now in the palm of your hand.

All of our therapists have a Master‚Äôs Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training and practice.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private ‚Äútherapy room‚Äù where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. Your partner will be invited to this room as well if you decide to try therapy together. You can also schedule a session so speak live with your therapist over video or phone.

You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you‚Äôre facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.

If you choose to try therapy on ReGain with your partner (either at the start of therapy, or if you choose to invite them later), your dialogue would be between all three of you: you, your partner, and your therapist. Together you will work towards making a positive change in your relationship and accomplishing your goals.

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
The cost of therapy through Regain ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your Regain membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the counseling service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.","100,000+ downloads",BetterHelp - Therapy Made Easy,"Jun 24, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.regain

=================================================
Plum Village: Zen Guided Meditation App ‚Äì Main Categories
=================================================

The Plum Village app is split into four easy-to-use categories ‚Äì meditations, talks, resources, and bells of mindfulness:

Meditations

Meditation is a deep practice that helps us generate peace and calm, master our mind, develop a healthy headspace, and get deep insights into ourselves and the world around us.

Meditations include deep relaxations, guided contemplations, silent meditations, and eating meditations. Whether you have a little time or a lot, and whether you want to be on your cushion or applying mindfulness in your daily life, there are meditations to nourish, inspire, and incorporate into your daily routine.

Talks

Listen and learn from the wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh and other Plum Village meditation teachers.

Ask Thay includes hundreds of real-life questions asked to the Zen Master, like ‚ÄúHow can we let go of anger? and ‚ÄúHow can I stop worrying?‚Äù His answers are compassionate and infused with insight.

Dharma Talks are teachings given by Thich Nhat Hanh and others on how to bring Buddhist wisdom and mindfulness into our life. Rather than discussing theoretical concepts, they focuses on direct and clear teachings to relieve suffering and create happiness in our day to day lives. Topics include depression, PTSD, relationships, sexual abuse, fear, and dealing with strong emotions.

Resources

In Resources you can find a library of daily practices, chants, poems, and songs. These bring to life the practices taught in Plum Village monasteries around the world and offer ways to bring mindfulness into our world, wherever we are.

Bell of Mindfulness

In Plum Village monasteries bells of mindfulness chime at regular intervals. Everybody stops and takes three mindful breaths to pause from their thinking or talking, breathe, and return to their bodies. The Bell of Mindfulness allows us to have the same reminder on our phone.

We can customize the bell to chime at different time periods. Settings include:
‚Ä¢ Start time / End time
‚Ä¢ Chime intervals
‚Ä¢ Bell volume
‚Ä¢ Daily repeating schedule

"Exercises from mindfulness and psychology for mental health and mood balance. Experience relaxation, learn to deal better with stress and intense emotions,
cultivate self care and think more positively.

Mindfulness techniques include breathing exercises, meditation, the stress tracker, and much more, to develop good habits. Cultivating mindful living can also support therapy, e.g. for borderline or depression.

Mindfulness2go supports you with the following topics:

POSITIVE THINKING
Targeted exercises direct your attention to the good things in your life. For example, with the exercise ""Positive sentence beginnings"", you direct your attention towards something positive in the middle of your day. End your day with a review of pleasant and helpful events. The exercise ""Three positive things"" supports you in doing that.


STRESS MANAGEMENT
The ""Stress tracker"" supports you in noticing from time to time how stressed you are in the moment. Your stress level over time becomes a stress curve. Add notes to use this as your mood diary. This helps you understand what causes you stress, improves your self-awareness and thereby facilitates stress management. Breathing exercises such as ""Calm breathing"" provide you with islands of relaxation in a stressful day.


BEING MINDFUL IN EVERYDAY LIFE
Mindfulness exercises for everyday life need very little time. Feeling the body, noticing your breath, seeing the good things, using all senses: discover a breadth of methods for being in the Here and Now. If you feel like challenging yourself, try ""Doing nothing"".


DEALING WITH INTENSE EMOTIONS
Skills help you interrupt high stress. Before you freak out, these exercises take your mind off things, and you gain back some freedom to choose. Two examples: The little helper ""Stone in the shoe"" draws your focus towards your body perception ‚Äí away from strong, negative feelings. Use ""5-4-3-2-1"" to concentrate deliberately on things in the outside world. This way you distract yourself actively from overwhelming emotions.


MEDITATION
Discover classic guided meditations as well as extra short meditations ""to go"" which only take a few minutes. For example, the ""Body scan"" is a classic mindfulness meditation ‚Äí a voyage through your body in the here and now. With the ""Mountain meditation"", you connect with two essential aspects: imperturbability and stability. A gong signals the beginning and end of every meditation.


SEEING THINGS MORE CLEARLY
Reflections offer you a structure to think through some basic questions. This supports you in taking decisions, such as whether a situation needs acceptance or change. It can also help you investigate limiting beliefs and verify whether they are (still) accurate. For example: ""Journaling"" helps you sort out the topics that are important to you. That results in increased clarity. Behind stressful feelings, you can often discover important needs that are insufficiently met. The exercise ""Emotions and needs"" helps you understand them better.


Generally, the app can help you find more balance in a stressful life, reduce stress sustainably, and thereby prevent burnout. If you‚Äôd like, the ""Daily to go"" can provide you with a mindful inspiration at the start of every day. All aspects of the app are supported by concise and easy to read background knowledge articles. Some of the exercises are available free of charge. A subscription is needed to access the full set of exercises.","1,000+ downloads",Achtsamkeit & Meer GmbH,"May 1, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindfulnesstogo.m2go

"What is Chakra Meditation Balancing?

We created this app to help you balance your 7 Chakras. Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body.The most important ones are seven, and they influence your life flow.

In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.

How to Balance your Chakras?

Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain tones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.

The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. This app was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.

We put a lot of passion in creating this app, so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.
For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.

*Chakra Meditation Balancing includes*
- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras
- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.
Now you can choose whether to log your timer sessions to the Health app as ""Mindful Minutes"".
- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.

This 7 Chakra Meditation for Body Healing and Cleansing app will help you to perform chakra activation and manage your energy within your body. This app includes all 7 chakra meditations audio and 3 special categories;

1. Root Chakra
2. Sacral Chakra
3. Solar Plexus Chakra
4. Heart Chakra
5. Throat Chakra
6. Third Eye Chakra
7. Crown Chakra
8. 7 Chakra Meditation
9. Chakra Meditation Collection
10. Chakra Meditation Handbook

What are chakras?

A chakra is a Sanskrit word that means wheel. In yoga and meditation, the chakras are wheels or discs located all over the body. There are seven main chakras aligned with the spine. They start from the base of the spine and move in a straight line, along the spine, through the crown. When energy flows unobstructed through these energy centers, your body, mind, and soul will appreciate the coordination and good health. Any obstruction to this flow could harm your overall well-being.

How does chakra healing work?

A series of major and minor energy centers - called chakras - exist in the body. The chakras are the energy centers of the physical body, where your beliefs and emotions are transformed into your state of health.

What are the benefits of healing the chakra?

Healing through the chakra is said to be able to cure almost any mental illness or disease. The process restores balance for each of the chakra sites, as it is believed that if the chakra has too much or too little energy, it will not function properly. The East Indian philosophy behind the healing of the chakras states that body and mind are connected and that a healthy body is a body in which the energies associated with each chakra are balanced and in harmony.

Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ This app is very beautiful and the music has so much relaxation in it. It's a peaceful app (from Jayy Anne)

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Perfect!! Quick timed meditation at my finger tips!!! Great for travel or the office (from Momanator)

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ After I downloaded the App, I started listening to the sounds just to hear what it sounds like. By the time I got to the fifth sound from the top I was in a deep meditative state. I was overwhelmed with happiness, love and joy. I also became grateful for everything in life. Thank you (from Marko_Ras)

"NOT JUST ANOTHER MEDITATION APP
Don‚Äôt think of Waking Up as a conventional meditation app‚Äîthink of it as a new operating system for your mind, and a guide to living a better life.

We aim to offer a far deeper approach to mindfulness than you‚Äôll find elsewhere‚Äîone that fundamentally transforms how you see yourself, and the world around you.

But you‚Äôll also discover life-changing, secular wisdom from top scholars and experts, on everything from sleep and doing good in the world to time management and happiness.

Waking Up is free for anyone who can‚Äôt afford it. We never want money to be the reason why someone can‚Äôt benefit from what we‚Äôve built.

**Created by Sam Harris
Sam Harris, neuroscientist and best-selling author, built Waking Up to be the resource he wished he‚Äôd had when he began exploring meditation over 30 years ago.

Sam only includes those practices and insights he‚Äôs found to be utterly life-changing. The same is true for the many teachers, scholars, and experts you‚Äôll meet throughout the app.

**A step-by-step approach to mindfulness
We‚Äôve heard from thousands of members who say they never really understood meditation until they took our 28-part Introductory Course.

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or advanced practitioner, you‚Äôll dive straight into the deep end of real mindfulness, so you don‚Äôt waste any time on the surface.

**Learn the true purpose of meditation
Meditation is about more than just relieving stress, sleeping better, or improving your focus. While it can help you do all of that, our goal is ultimately to help you open the door to a deeper understanding of yourself.

Here, you won‚Äôt just uncover simple relaxation techniques ‚Äîand you won‚Äôt find any New Age fluff or religious dogma.

**A place for serious seekers
Explore some of life‚Äôs most important questions, on topics like neuroscience, psychedelics, enlightenment, ethics, and Stoicism‚Äîfrom renowned authors and professors like Oliver Burkeman, Michael Pollan, Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, James Clear, and others.

**In-depth theory and practice
Waking Up explains both the theory and the practice of meditation ‚Äîso you don‚Äôt just learn the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of mindfulness, but also the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù

You‚Äôll be guided by prominent figures like Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, JayasƒÅra, and Henry Shukman, who teach a wide range of contemplative practices, including Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta, and more.

**Timeless insights, modern lens
Within Waking Up, you‚Äôll find some of the most profound spiritual teachings from throughout history‚Äîthose that have stood the test of time. And you‚Äôll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.

But we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won‚Äôt find outlandish claims or anything we haven‚Äôt found to be empirically true.

**A comprehensive guide
Waking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You‚Äôll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.

‚ÄúWaking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I‚Äôve ever used.‚Äù Physician Peter Attia

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!‚Äù -Susan Cain, best-selling author

‚ÄúWaking Up is not an app, it‚Äôs a path. It is equal parts a meditation guide, a philosophy master-class and a highly-focused TED Conference.‚Äù -Eric Hirschberg, former CEO of ACTIVISION

"THE WAY is a new kind of meditation app: a single path, led by an authorized Zen master, that guides you on a deep meditation training program. Study alongside Zen master Henry Shukman as you uncover the deep peace, love, insight and awakening that meditation can bring stress relief.

The simple path to deeper meditation.

With THE WAY, you will:

*** Never feel overwhelmed by choice. The Way guides you step-by-step along a single, linear path through all the key areas of a deep and fulfilling meditation practice. You never have to worry about which meditation to choose with The Way.

*** Experience real transformation and deep wellbeing. Progress along a proven pathway of meditation that helps you to awaken to the true nature of your mind, your self, and your relationship to the world. Explore Zen koans, non-dual awareness and other awakening techniques.

*** Benefit from an authorized Zen Master as your guide with The Way. Study with a beloved teacher with over 35 years of meditation practice. Learn Henry Shukman‚Äôs innovative fusion of modern mindfulness, Jhana practice and Sanbo Zen teaching.

HENRY SHUKMAN teaches mindfulness and awakening practices to a wide range of students from all traditions and walks of life. Henry is an authorized Zen Master in the Sanbo Zen lineage, and is the Spiritual Director of Mountain Cloud Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His struggles and traumatic experiences as a youth, combined with a spontaneous awakening experience at 19, paved the way for Henry to develop a well-rounded approach to meditation.

On the journey of THE WAY, you can learn to:

*** Calm the nervous system, reduce stress on a daily basis and release trauma over time.
*** Enjoy a stress free life with our daily guided meditation app, The Way.
*** Prioritize mental health and get into a relaxation mode.

*** Access beautiful states of flow and absorption during meditation

THE WAY works through a series of daily guided meditations and talks along a single path of practice. Through these calm guided meditations you will explore with Zen Master Henry Shukman: teaching from ancient Buddhist traditions, finding peace and unconditional wellbeing in the heart of our lives, learning how to sit with and process negative emotions, healing from past traumas, uncovering deep joy in the bare fact of being alive, discovering a deep and connected presence, understanding insights into non-duality and awakening to the true nature of reality. All grounded in modern mindfulness and ancient Zen wisdom. Experience Self-care, the sense of unwinding anxiety like never before with The Way.

"‚Ä¢ 2024 Pick: Best Meditation App by Healthline, The New York Times Wirecutter, Vogue, and Sports Illustrated

Well-being is a skill that can be learned. We‚Äôre here to guide you along the way.

Backed by four decades of research from world-renowned neuroscientist Dr. Richard Davidson and the team at Healthy Minds Innovations & the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄîMadison, the Healthy Minds Program trains your mind through meditation and podcast-style lessons to develop skills for gaining focus, reducing stress, and maintaining positive social connections.

Research with the Healthy Minds App showed that just 5 minutes a day of practice leads to a 28% reduction in stress, an 18% reduction in anxiety, a 24% reduction in depression, and a 13% increase in social connection.

Featuring our scientific Awareness, Connection, Insight, and Purpose, Well-being Framework, the Healthy Minds Program is a holistic, all-encompassing meditation app that offers the best of both guided meditations and opportunities to learn. You‚Äôll learn simple skills to enhance personal well-being, build healthy relationships, and improve communication, performance, and creativity.

What makes us unique?

Developed from Science:
While many meditation apps can claim the scientific benefits of meditation, our practices are developed directly from neuroscientific research. You‚Äôll also hear from the world‚Äôs foremost neuroscientists about neuroplasticity and how to train your mind.

Made for Busy Lives:
Our app features active meditation practices that fit into your busy lifestyle. Don‚Äôt have time to sit for 20 minutes? Put on an active practice and train your mind while you fold the laundry.

Guided by Measurement:
Thanks to our pioneering scientific research, the Healthy Minds Program offers the first mobile mental and emotional well-being assessments. Learn about your current level of well-being and contribute to cutting-edge research on the science of well-being. Our app also integrates with Apple Health to track your mindful minutes.

Goes Beyond Mindfulness:
Our guided path offers step-by-step instructions for becoming more present in the moment and developing a sense of purpose, meaning, and connection in life.

Driven by Mission and Supported by Donation:
The Healthy Minds Program is made possible by our donors, who support our vision of a kinder, wiser, more compassionate world. Unlike other apps that require a subscription, the Healthy Minds Program is available by donation, driven by a mission to translate science into tools to cultivate and measure well-being.

üéØ What is the purpose of meditation?

The goal of meditation is the purification of the mind from restless and obsessive thoughts.
There are two ways to meditate: meditation on the void and meditation through concentration. As an object of attention take a point on the wall, the fire of a candle or a painted image. It is important that attention is not distracted. When you feel fully focused, your thoughts will melt and you will enter a state of meditation.

The problem of beginners is that attention is difficult to keep at one point. You have to constantly remind yourself ‚Äúdo not get distracted!‚Äù And the state of meditation is lost.

This application allows you to set a sound reminder, so as not to be distracted. When you hear it, you will return to the point of concentration and the state of meditation will not be interrupted.

In the practice of meditation by concentration it is not necessary to sit in a particular position or in a particular place. This may be lying, standing, in bed or in transport. You can set the duration of the meditation yourself. Even 5, 10 minute meditation will increase awareness and give strength. Morning, daytime, evening (before bedtime) or even night meditation - the choice is yours!

There is no need to take meditation lessons - become a guru for yourself, and the application will be like a good helper.


The application is suitable for practitioners: Pranayama, Kundalini Yoga, Hatha, Kriya, Tantra, Bhakti, Karma, Jnana, Raja, Japa, Dhyana, Sahaja, Samadhi, Chakra Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Vipassana, Qigong, Affirmation, Zen, loving kindness (metta), meditation on the opening of the third eye, trataka, nada, visualization, presence meditation, sarguna, nirguna, fitness meditation.

"Welcome to the Pranaria.
Few people know what a big role breathe exercise plays in the life of each of us.

Correct and deep breathing with the diaphragm allows you to increase the volume of air inhaled by the lungs and improve the saturation of body cells with oxygen. Pranayama completely normalizes the work of the whole organism: equalizes pressure, improves heart function, removes anxiety and stress. According to the lung capacity test: they hold 3-6 liters of air, but usually, our effective volume is just only 400-500 ml of air.

In Pranaria, we have collected the best free breathing exercises based on both ancient Vedic and Sufi prana yoga practices and modern scientific research.

How practices can help:
‚¶ø Prana breathe yoga will help you to relax and focus;
‚¶ø You can use paced pranayama breathing app for anxiety, for asthma, for high blood pressure, and panic attacks. As a result, you can easily and effectively control your emotions;
‚¶ø Lung capacity training: Restore the vital volume;
‚¶ø Inhale exhale timer will increase the level of brain activity: your attention, concentration, and memory;
‚¶ø Learn to induce a state of calmness and relaxation in yourself with the help of proper prana breath and relax control exercise;

We have developed a special lungs test that measures your current volume with the help o inhale exhale timer. By doing exercises and prana, you can track your current level of lungs capacity and observe it in dynamics.

"The way we breathe determines the way we live.

Relaxed, harmonious breathing signifies health, calmness, a steady pace of life, and high stress resistance.

That's meditation, in which the body breathes in step with the mind.

Our breathing depends on our own state of mind and changes along with it. It can therefore vary between being energetic and elevated when we're excited, frequent and shallow when we're stressed, or free, even, and smooth when we're calm and relaxed.

By controlling our breathing, we can manage our own well-being, calm our emotions, and improve our health.

Deep, relaxed breathing improves the exchange of gases in our lungs, affects the functioning of all internal organs, and reduces stress. We become calmer, more relaxed, and thus more successful.
Our quality of life improves, we have more energy and strength, and our health improves.

In this app you'll find:

‚ú¶ simple practice of relaxing breathing
‚ú¶ possibility to set your own breathing rhythms

"Explore your full potential in apnea diving in the depths of the sea with our Freedive and Apnea Trainer App! This Apnea Trainer provides you with all the necessary tools to enhance your skills in apnea, diving, or freediving and push your own limits in the fascinating world of breath-hold diving. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the fundamentals of freediving or an experienced apnea master seeking to optimize your performance and knowledge on static apnea, dynamic apnea, constant weight freediving or free immersion freediving, this Apnea trainer is perfect for you.

Our Freedive and Apnea Trainer App offers:

ü§ø Progress logs and Apnea statistics: Track your personal apnea shape by recording tests. Access charts displaying apnea duration, and sort by date or record time. Use these charts to analyze your progress and automatically adjust trainings to improve your tolerance to carbon dioxide accumulation and lack of oxygen in each apnea session.

ü§ø CO2 Tables: The goal of CO2 tables is to help you build tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide. In this type of table the apnea time is the same for the entire workout, but the breathing time gradually reduces in each set. These values are defined based on your personal best breath-hold or another customer value of your preference.

ü§ø O2 Tables: The goal of O2 tables is to help your body adapt to low oxygen levels. In this type of table the breathing time is the same for the entire workout, but the apnea time gradually increases in each set. These values are defined based on your personal best breath-hold or another customer value of your preference.

ü§ø Flexible training based on your needs: Choose the workout that fits better your current personal experience and goals.

ü§øTutorials: Learn as you train thanks to our contextual interface, that will guide you step by step to learn the basics and understand the key concepts while you keep practicing and improving your breath-holding capacity.

ü§ø Active freediving community: Follow us on social media to connect with a passionate community of beginners, advanced and professional freedivers. Engage and enjoy our social media platforms showcasing diving images from the world's most famous diving and apnea spots.

Apnea diving is not only a fascinating activity in nature but also offers a range of physical and mental benefits. By practicing freediving or apnea, you strengthen your lung capacity and develop greater stamina. Moreover, you'll learn to control your mind and emotions underwater, experiencing a sense of calm and tranquility as you dive with your diving goggles in the crystal-clear waters surrounded by fish and corals.

To improve and train apnea, it's essential to work on developing proper breathing techniques and increasing your lung capacity underwater. Through specific breathing exercises and apnea training, you can extend your time underwater and reach greater depths effortlessly. Mental relaxation and breath control are key aspects to consider when enhancing your skills in apnea, diving, and freediving.

Additionally, it's important to engage in regular and progressive diving or apnea training, always respecting your personal limits and, most importantly, listening to your body. A gradual approach and consistent practice of the art of underwater apnea will allow you to surpass your own records and enjoy more intense and pleasurable underwater experiences.

In summary, immersing yourself in apnea diving offers a unique opportunity to explore the underwater world like few others can. As you delve into the depths of the sea, you can improve your apnea skills through proper technique, lung capacity development, and consistent practice of the ancient art of tankless diving.

Professor Kazuomi Sugamoto‚Äôs laboratory research team of the Biomaterial Science research center at Osaka University have developed the world's first method of orthopedic disease treatment by analyzing joint movement in three dimensions.
As a result, this method revealed that voluntary movements of living human beings are different from involuntary movements observed in donor bodies. Noticing the difference the research team, with the aid of 20-30 participants, used CT or MRI scans of all the joints and joint movements in the human body, a process which took over 10 years to complete and analyze.","10,000+ downloads","Oct 12, 2022","Jan 27, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamLabBody.crossSection

"Third Eye Opening Brainwaves Meditation

Third Eye uses extremely powerful meditation music focused on third eye opening and the elevation of consciousness. This is achieved through pineal gland stimulation using brainwave entrainment music. The result of elevated consciousness is an increase in our natural extrasensory abilities. With elevated consciousness, awareness, creativity, extrasensory perception, and intuition are all increased.

The third eye serves as the connection to all knowledge and endless creativity. The pineal gland is stimulated through the use of isochronic modulation which is the most advanced form of brainwave entrainment. Through brainwave entrainment, elevated states of delta, alpha, theta, beta or gamma wave are increased and the mind is placed into the proper meditative state.

With daily Pinealwave meditation the third eye will be opened and consciousness will be elevated. The power and potential of meditation being used to activate the pineal gland has been known and used by many cultures throughout the history of mankind.

THE POWER OF THIRD EYE OPENING

The concept of the third eye is a spiritual and philosophical one that is found in various cultures and belief systems around the world. It is often associated with the pineal gland, which is a small gland in the brain that is believed to regulate the body's circadian rhythms. Here are some of the potential benefits that are associated with opening the third eye:

Increased intuition: Opening the third eye is said to enhance your ability to perceive and understand subtle energies and to trust your intuition.
Clarity of mind: By activating the third eye, you may experience greater mental clarity and focus, as well as an improved ability to concentrate and retain information.
Spiritual insight: Third eye awakening can lead to deeper understanding of spiritual concepts and experiences, including meditation, mindfulness, and yoga.
Enhanced creativity: By opening the third eye, you may experience greater inspiration and creativity, as well as an increased ability to access your imagination.
Improved health: Some people believe that opening the third eye can improve physical health by regulating the body's internal rhythms and promoting overall balance and harmony.

"AI-Dermatologist: Your Personal Skin Health Monitoring App

Experience the revolutionary AI-Dermatologist app, a cutting-edge solution to monitor your skin health and identify any potential skin conditions that require attention.

We all desire healthy and radiant skin, and achieving this goal necessitates consistent efforts and various skincare methods. Whether it's identifying rashes, nevus or cancer, checking moles, analyzing your skin's condition, or scanning for acne. AI-Dermatologist combines all these functions and recognizes 58 different skin conditions in one convenient application. By incorporating today's most advanced Artificial Intelligence technologies and drawing from the expertise of dermatology professionals, our app empowers you to assess the risk of various skin issues, such as spots, birthmarks, acne, moles, or papillomas.

In just one minute, AI-Dermatologist provides you with valuable insights and recommends the appropriate next steps to take if any concerns arise. Furthermore, the app enables you to store photos, allowing you to monitor changes over time and track your skin's health in the long run. By creating an AI-Dermatologist, we aim to make skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.

With AI-Dermatologist, you can enjoy the following features:
- Capture snapshots of skin spots, birthmarks, moles, and other skin conditions, including angiomas, warts, papillomas, mollusks, and more.

It is essential to understand that an AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and cannot replace or substitute a visit to your doctor. Our application aims to raise awareness of your skin condition through self-examination, but it should not be considered an online dermatology platform. If you ever notice any discomfort or changes in your skin spot, such as irritation, itchiness, or bleeding, we strongly advise reaching out to a medical specialist promptly. Early consultation with a healthcare professional can help avoid potential risks associated with melanoma or other skin diseases.

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Slumber is Better for sleep than the Calm app
I bought Slumber & Calm at the same time. When I want help sleeping, I find myself turning to Slumber only. Their narrators are more skilled in the relaxing & soothing style of speaking. You don't need celebrities; you need people with calming, wonderful voices who know how to read in a hypnotherapy-style cadence. And Slumber has better sleep sound options, and you have more control over those options. I also like that you can choose to keep playing the background noise, and perhaps a sound like rain, for a set amount of time after the narration ends. Also‚Äî better calm stories designed for relaxing, comforting sleep too! Plus, the price is better.

"What is CBT?

CBT is Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is effective and commonly used for a variety of mental health concerns. ‚ÄòC‚Äô is for cognitive and refers to what and how we think. ‚ÄòB‚Äô is for behavioral or how we act. Cognitive-Behavioral is about the relationship between our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

Those thoughts, emotions, and behaviours connect to our moods, our physical experiences, and events in our lives. Being aware of how negative thoughts about an event or experience might be affecting how we act, or perceive a situation, can change our emotional, behavioural and physical responses to it.

"The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations.

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","1,000,000+ downloads","Mar 29, 2018","Jul 12, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northstar.gratitude

"FreeCBT is an open source thought diary for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the ""gold standard"" of psychotherapy and is widely considered to be one of the most effective, evidence backed treatments for depression, anxiety, and panic. If you go into just about any therapist or psychiatrist, CBT will likely be one of the first treatments they try.


FreeCBT is a companion and self-help app for one of the most common formats of CBT. You may have heard it called ""the three column technique"" or ""catch it, check it, change it."" Your brain is really good at making you feel exactly what you're thinking. Often, we find ourselves thinking ""automatic negative thoughts"" that lead us to fume on something that may not be true. That can cause us to feel depressed or anxious.


CBT helps you record ""automatic thoughts,"" challenge them with cognitive distortions and then train your brain with an alternative thought. If you do it enough, you can change your thoughts, your moods and your behavior.

"How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.

Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you‚Äôre truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.

An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you‚Äôll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.

As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.


There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:

- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.
- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you‚Äôre creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.
- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.

"PsychSurveys simplifies the process of psychometric assessment; an essential element of evidence based treatment. Mental health professionals in private or group practices can use PsychSurveys to administer customizable diary cards/tracking sheets as well as valid and reliable mental health surveys to their patients to measure distress levels and track patient progress over time. PsychSurveys was developed in partnership with psychologists who are intensively trained in cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies. It improves client care by allowing you to objectively measure your clients' symptoms and use the results to highlight progress or identify areas needing further intervention.

Simply choose which survey(s) you wish to have your patient(s) complete and how often. Patients can use either the mobile app for alerts and completion of surveys at home or while in session, or they can receive email alerts with links to complete surveys using a web browser on a PC or mobile device. Patients can opt out of the email alerts at any time simply by clicking the link in the email to opt out.

If patients use the mobile app, they'll see reminders and alerts on their iPhone or iPad when surveys are due and a badge icon indicating how many surveys are due.

As surveys are completed, they are automatically scored. Each patient's progress is tracked over time for each applicable survey. The reports include all relevant scales and sub-scales and you can drill down to see how the patient responded to the questions in the surveys for each time they completed a survey.

We offer 150 pre-configured surveys:

Diary Cards are a tool to help patients track emotions, urges, and behaviors on a daily basis. This aids clinicians in identifying their patients areas of struggle over the course of the week to more effectively prioritize session time and identify points for intervention. The diary card also functions as a tool for increasing awareness of emotions and urges for clients, as well as helping them identify Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills they could use in moments of distress. When patients complete Diary Cards, the results are available for viewing instantly. There is no need for patients to email their diary cards to you each week. This feature is fully customizable and could be used as tracking sheets focusing on emotions, urges, and behaviors for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) based interventions as well.

With PsychSurveys, patients do not need to email you their results from surveys and diary cards - the results are available to you in real-time automatically. In addition, setting up surveys and diary cards for patients is quick, simple, and centralized.","10,000+ downloads",,"Nov 14, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychsurveys.psychsurveys

"Get ready for the ACT and SAT with this research-based ACT App. It will help you study for the SAT or the ACT by teaching you key concepts with flashcards. It is an essential for all SAT and ACT prep.

The ACT app includes:

‚òû ACT math
‚òû New SAT math
‚òû ACT science
‚òû English basics such as Grammar and Vocabulary


ACT Practice that is Research-based
=====
Research shows that flashcards are one of the best ways to study: they help with information retrieval, or recall. Recall of memory means that you are able to quickly access information learned in the past, which has been stored in your brain. Flashcards are one of the best ways to practice information recall. Using this ACT App, you will practice remembering ACT and SAT concepts so that on test day, you will easily be able to recall this information, even under pressure.

Research also shows that spaced repetition, or seeing the same concept repeated many times while you prep is the best way to practice recalling information quickly. This ACT practice app uses an algorithm based on the Spaced Repetition Technique. The Spaced Repetition Technique comes from academic research, which shows that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information at different intervals. When you practice with this ACT prep App, you‚Äôll notice that concepts are tagged as ""mastered"", ""reviewing"" or ""learning"". Concepts that you are ""learning"" will appear most frequently, until you master them, and then they will appear less frequently so that you can continue to review them.


Student-validated
=====
This ACT App underwent rigorous testing with students. We have used student feedback to continuously improve the content and clarity of our flashcards. The result is an engaging and seamless experience that lets you focus on learning without any distractions.

We intended for this app to be for ACT practice only, but have since found that it is very helpful for students practicing for the SAT, as well as other standardized exams for which basic math and verbal skills are tested such as the GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, Praxis and GED. All of our students find the ACT math sections especially helpful.

"Writing Therapy is a unique app for spelling practice for adults with brain injury or stroke as well as ESL speakers.

** Try it for FREE in Language Therapy Lite **

With 4 modes and 3 levels of difficulty in each, users have access to 12 different exercises to practice writing over 500 words + unlimited custom words!

* Fill-in-the-Blank
* Copy
* Spell What You See
* Spell What You Hear

Unlike other learn-to-spell apps, Writing Therapy allows users to select and rearrange letter tiles until they are satisfied, choosing when to submit an answer, rather than letters only fitting into the correct spot. Writing Therapy also has a built-in cueing hierarchy to give ""hints"" on each level, making the exercise one step easier to allow success on each trial. A virtual set of letter tiles makes therapy go faster with more repetitions in less time.

You can add your own words and pictures to create completely customized spelling lists! Learn to spell names, places, or words related to each user's needs.

This app features clear photographs, iconic graphics, and a clear male voice in 5 languages. Users will benefit from the trial-and-error format and self-selected cues for learning these common words with graduated activities that will grow with them as they develop or improve.

Settings allow limiting the length of the words, selecting capital or lowercase letters, designating which of 12 categories are presented, and choosing how letters are selected. For users with difficulty dragging, an alternative tapping access method is available. Speech-Language Pathologists, family members, and teachers can recommend the appropriate modes and levels for each user and receive e-mailed reports of results (ready for professional progress notes).

Writing Therapy is another powerful app in Tactus Therapy Solutions' professionally-designed Language Therapy suite of speech-language therapy apps. It is the perfect companion to Comprehension Therapy, Naming Therapy, and Reading Therapy.

"This application uses many advanced digital techniques and simulates EMDR therapy. EMDR is a technique recommended by psychotherapists and Psychologists.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an extensively researched psychotherapy method proven to be effective and help people recover from trauma and other distressing life experiences which are including depression, PTSD, panic disorders, anxiety.

The American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs/Dept. of Defense, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the World Health Organization among many other national and international organizations recognize and recommend EMDR therapy as an effective treatment.

First, put on your headphones, think of a traumatic and disturbing event. Follow the ball in the EMDR tool, focus on the transition of sounds in your left and right ears, and feel the vibrations. Thus, the effect of traumatic disturbing events that will provide the data flow between the right and left brain as in REM sleep will decrease.
Focus on the trauma memory while simultaneously experiencing bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements), which is associated with a reduction in the vividness and emotion associated with the trauma memories.
While you bring the details of that memory to mind, This tool will guide you through a series of side-to-side eye movements, auditory (with direction), and vibrations. As you learn to process the memory and related feelings it brings up, you‚Äôll gradually be able to reframe that memory in a more positive light.

Use three types of BLS: visual, auditory (with direction), and vibrations and modify your settings to suit your preferences.
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro in the 1980s that was originally designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In EMDR, the person being treated recalls distressing experiences whilst doing bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye movement or physical stimulation, such as tapping either side of the body.

According to the theory behind the approach, traumatic and painful memories can cause post-traumatic stress when you don‚Äôt process them completely. Then, when sights, sounds, words, or smells trigger those unprocessed memories, you re-experience them.

The 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) practice guideline states that EMDR ""is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements.

This re-experiencing leads to the emotional distress and other symptoms recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
EMDR aims to reduce symptoms of trauma by changing how your memories are stored in your brain. In a nutshell, an EMDR therapist does this by leading you through a series of bilateral (side-to-side) eye movements as you recall traumatic or triggering experiences in small segments, until those memories no longer cause distress.","10,000+ downloads",,"Jul 15, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garfmedya.EMDR

"I'm developing this app on my own in my spare time outside of work, so that I can continue to offer it for free.

This app is free, ad-free, and without data collection. Forever.

Life Notes is an app that allows you to record your chronic symptoms and lifestyle habits on a daily basis in order to monitor them, but also to potentially highlight some correlations.

It's possible to create your own symptom list in order to score them day after day, rating thef pain level intensity on a scale from 0 to 5.

It's also possible to record your meals, medications and add various notes, as well as your sleep schedules to highlight the causes of your symptoms. For example, it is easier to highlight the link between some of your meals and your possible stomach aches.

In addition to noting the daily evolution of the symptoms at different times of the day, it's also possible to enter an overall level of pain intensity over the course of a day in order to have a broader view of their evolution.

In short, Life-Notes offers what a simple notebook could do for you, but with a focus on tracking symptoms and providing statistics.

None of your data is sent online, 100% of your data is stored on your phone's memory.

"We all have feelings and emotions but very often it is really hard to share them with other persons. Even before smartphones many of us use to write in a real diary witch many times was just a notepad in which we were writing down everything that we felt without worrying that we will be judged. Many of us, if not all, made our diary a secret diary just to be sure that no one reads it. Either is was a love diary or just a daily diary we loved it and share every emotion and thought. First crush, fight with your parents, first heartbreak, the time when you really felt in love ... all these moments were always shared with your dear diary.

Now, in our modern times, the simple old trusty journal notepad had become a application on our mobile device which allows us to do more in less time and very often in a more secure way.
With that in mind we though to put our ideas, regarding to what WE believe a journal should be, in making a simple, intuitive and comprehensive diary application that will be your partner who listens but doesn't share anything that you think and feel.

To make it perfect for how we would like it to be we have included the following cool features:

WORD CLOUD - Visualise your life, emotions and feelings in one place

Sentiments and feelings are part of our life and sharing them with someone or even for ourselves in a simple diary can make our life more enjoyable and pleasant. Reading what we've wrote in the past can help us understand who we are and what moments have defined our life. In a complex and always in a hurry world, writing down your precious moments in a intimate way in a intimate journal will always help you embrace the world in a beautiful and healthy way.

"Stop Anxiety is the guide that shows you how the mind works, why you suffered from anxiety in the first place. It then gives you a step-by-step program to free yourself from destructive behavior and thoughts, and to gain freedom from the tyranny of thoughts and emotions, to come out from under the umbrella of fear and terror, i.e. to free yourself from anxiety.

This program is for you if:

‚óè you want to stop getting pissed off at the town hall, IRS, government, bank and a few other institutions and companies
‚óè husband, mother-in-law and mother gang up on you and make your life miserable
‚óè colleagues at work abuse/bully you
‚óè you no longer trust yourself
‚óè you have no motivation to do things
‚óè procrastinate
‚óè you lose control of your emotions, thoughts and body
‚óè you think you will die

And you want to:

‚óè stop letting others influence your emotions
‚óè stop caring about what others say
‚óè regain the power and control you had before
‚óè spend more time with yourself, stop being a slave to your husband, mother-in-law, children
‚óè find the joy of living

Free stress, anxiety and depression test

Before launching the program, you have the opportunity to measure your levels of stress, anxiety and depression. These levels will drop after a week or two of getting into the program.

Stop Anxiety offers a scientific method of self-diagnose, based on the DASS test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASS_(psychology)

Make sure to seek a doctor‚Äôs advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.

Structure of the STOP ANXIETY program

Week 1

‚óè Discover how to control your thoughts and emotions (control)
‚óè Introduce the middle path, the golden path as a guiding value in your life (efficiency decisions)

‚óè Count the abusers and rescuers in your life and discover how to manage them (control, self-protection)

We know you don't have the time, so we've synthesized the psychological material for you to get the most out of it, with a minimum of time investment.

Among the theories and techniques used are:
‚óè CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy)
‚óè ACT (Acceptance and commitment therapy),
‚óè MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy).

All these types of psychotherapy are scientifically proven to work in relieving anxiety and even depression!

"Trident Mindset is a mental health and mental toughness training program created by Navy SEALs, intelligence operatives, and neuroscientists that teaches proven tactics for reducing stress, increasing happiness, and thriving during adversity.

We believe the quality of your mindset determines the quality of your life. Our mission is to teach you to master your mindset so you can live your happiest life.

Trident Mindset teaches 12 proven tactics that will help you be calm, effective, and happy no matter what life throws at you: micro-goals, focus, breath control, intentionality, choosing the wrench, stoicism, discipline, meditation, mindfulness, flipping the script, self talk and visualization. Through concise daily lessons, practice exercises, and check-ins, you'll learn to master all 12 tactics.

The program begins with the Mindset 101 Course - a 12-day course that introduces you to 1 of the 12 mindset tactics each day.

Then you'll advance to the 12-month Mindset Mastery Course. Each month teaches you to master 1 of the 12 tactics. Each day of the month includes a 5-minute lesson, practice exercise, and check-in that teaches you something new about that month's tactic. We spend a month on each tactic, so you have time to turn the tactic into a lasting habit before you move on to the next one.

We believe life should be spent being happy. But it can be hard to find happiness amidst all the adversity and challenge we face in life. In our careers, we were fortunate to learn a set of tactics that helped us be calm, effective, and happy no matter what was going on. These tactics proved themselves in the laboratory, on the battlefield, and everywhere in between. Learning these tactics changed our lives profoundly, so we're now dedicating our lives to teaching them to everyone.

By learning to master our mindsets, we can all learn to be calm, effective, and happy in every moment rather than only when things are going well. We hope you'll join us.

You can learn more at tridentmindset.com.

Onward!

"Commonality turns you into your own body‚Äôs Chief Scientist, with:

- All your health tracking in one place
- Flexible tracking that captures symptoms, menstruation, mood, sleep, stress, mental health and anxiety.
- Menstrual hormone levels (FSH, Estrogen, Progesterone, LH) are automatically calculated and analysed.
- Weather and air quality are also automatically imported and analysed.

Next Level Analysis That Actually Works
Tracking is pointless unless it helps you work out what is affecting you. This is why Commonality is built around our iHealthDiscovery analysis engine that offers much more than the usual ‚Äòcorrelations‚Äô. iHealthDiscovery is the result of a PhD and 4 years of development and uses advanced machine learning to find the needle in your health hay-stack, without all the ‚Äòfalse positives‚Äô given by correlations.

The Power to Learn From Your Experiments
When you try a new supplement, medication or treatment, you probably don‚Äôt think you are doing science, but you are. Commonality empowers you to learn from the experiments you are already doing (we call them ‚Äòhacks‚Äô) just like you had your own research lab. At the end of a ‚Äòhack‚Äô we give you a research grade analysis of whether it made any difference, using our iHealthTest engine.


Commonality helps you:
- Fully customise your tracking to suit your goals and health.
- Access research grade analysis and insights through the iHealthDiscovery engine.
- Become your own Chief Scientist, run experiments (‚Äòhacks‚Äô) and assess results with the iHealthTest engine.
- Store data across multiple devices

"Anxiety Release based on EMDR shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.

Because bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;
1 x brain training session
2 x guided anxiety management sessions
1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)
1 x safe place exercise
Progress Log function with prompts
Powerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction

This App is suitable for both clinicians and the general public. However, persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision.

"Calmer ‚Äì Your Anxiety Relief Toolkit

If you have ever struggled with anxiety or depression, you have probably heard some version of this advice:
""Just stop overthinking.""
""Try essential oils!""
""You have nothing to be anxious and sad about.""

The truth? Anxiety and depression is not a choice. And it does not disappear just because someone tells you to ‚Äúcalm down.‚Äù

When anxiety and panic attacks take over, you do not need motivational advice or another meditation app. You need real, research-backed tools to help you reset and regulate your nervous system.

That is why we created Calmer.

Whether you are dealing with shortness of breath, heart palpitations, racing thoughts, a tight chest, or the fear of another panic attack, this app gives you practical techniques to find relief‚Äîquickly and effectively.

What Calmer Offers

- SOS calming techniques ‚Äì Quick-acting tools to help manage anxiety and panic attacks in the moment

- Daily mental fitness plan ‚Äì Simple, actionable habits to retrain your nervous system and lower stress levels
- Insights from psychology and neuroscience ‚Äì No vague advice, just proven strategies that work

Why Choose Calmer?

Most anxiety apps focus only on mindfulness, but when your heart is racing and your thoughts are spiraling, meditation alone is not always the answer. Calmer is different. It gives you a complete toolkit‚Äîa combination of immediate relief techniques and long-term strategies to help you take control of your anxiety.

- Built on science ‚Äì Developed with psychologists and based on research-backed methods
- Practical and effective ‚Äì Simple, easy-to-use tools that fit into your daily life
- For real-life anxiety ‚Äì Whether it is work stress, social anxiety, or panic attacks, Calmer adapts to you

"Is anxiety making your life a lot harder than it needs to be?

Do you find yourself worrying a lot, thinking the worst, catastrophizing about what might happen?

The worst thing about anxiety is it's very difficult to think yourself out of it. Anxious feelings create anxious thoughts, which create anxious feelings and so on. It's a vicious circle with you at its center.

But there is some good news. The free hypnosis session in the app - Overcome Fear & Anxiety - will relax you so wonderfully deeply that for a good while afterwards your anxiety levels will be much, much lower, if you have any anxiety at all.

Then, repeated listening will calm your nervous system so profoundly that it will start to get much harder to get anxious, and when you start to feel that way a lot of the time, the anxiety problem will be well on its way to being sorted for good.

With over 20 years experience, and more than 1/2 million hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to set your mind at rest.

The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session. You can use that for as long as you like, but if you want more variety at any time you can upgrade to the monthly paid option and access 10 more anxiety sessions.

Our most popular anxiety session 'Overcome Fear & Anxiety' is free inside the app to reduce your anxiety right away. Then, if you like what you hear, you can unlock the other anxiety sessions with the monthly payment option.

From Uncommon Knowledge, delivering hypnosis since 1998.

3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?
When we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good.

Remember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.

So we made the app we needed:
A tool based on what actually helped us, and what psychologists say works best ‚Äî exposure, reflection, and small daily actions that retrain your brain.

Hatchr helps you:
- Face social fears with daily exposure challenges
- Track your confidence and progress over time
- Learn how your mind and body respond to social stress
- Grow at your own pace, in a low-pressure environment

No therapy speak. No pressure to be fearless.
Just practical steps to feel more confident in real life ‚Äî backed by science, built from experience.

Start where you are.
Grow at your pace.
Get braver, one day at a time.

Please note: Hatchr is a subscription-based app. A paid subscription is required to access content and features.

How it works
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we‚Äôre able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don‚Äôt have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.

"The Flow depression treatment is a free personal guide to help you understand and improve your mental health.

Flow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.

The app can be used on its own and offers an education programme with over 50 sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural coaching and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.

Used as a companion tool for the Flow brain stimulation headset, this is a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app.

The Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com

The programme contains over 50 education sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:

- Exercise

Physical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow education explores the types of exercise that are beneficial.

- Meditation

Meditation is practised by many people around the world as mental ‚Äúexercise‚Äù for the brain. Flow will give you exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.

- Sleep

Did you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.

- Nutrition

The nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.","50,000+ downloads",,"May 16, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flowneuroscience.flow.droid

"Simple and small app to boost your speaker or headphone sound volume. Useful for movies, audio books and music.

Use at your own risk. Playing audio at high volumes, especially for a prolonged amount of time, can destroy speakers and/or damage hearing. Some users HAVE reported destroyed speakers and earphones. If you hear distorted audio, lower the volume (but it may be too late).

By installing this application you agree that you will not hold its developer responsible for any damage to hardware or hearing, and you are using it at your own risk. Consider this to be experimental software.

Not all devices support this software. Try it at your own risk and see if yours works.

This app does not work on most 4.2.1-4.3 devices. It should work on 4.4 and higher, as well as on devices below 4.2.1.

This is not for adjusting the speakerphone volume in phone calls (that has its own boost, I think), but for adjusting the volume of music, movies and apps.

When you set the boost to zero, Volume Booster will be off. The notification icon is just for ease of launching. If you don't like seeing the notification icon when Volume Booster is off, just go to Volume Booster's Settings and set it to appear only when Volume Booster is running.","50,000,000+ downloads",,"Jun 5, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodev.volume.booster

Note

Due to its many features Mood Patterns is NOT the simplest mood tracker. It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).


Details


Gain insights into your feelings

A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but Mood Patterns can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.


Capture how you feel in your daily life

Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries.

To capture all parts of your life that matter Mood Patterns uses a technique of the social sciences: ecological momentary assessment also known as experience sampling.


You are unique

Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With Mood Patterns, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.


Your data is yours

How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. Mood Patterns does not request Internet permission, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. Mood Patterns will not send us or anybody else your data.


Your data is safe

Denying Mood Patterns Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An app lock assures that only you can use your Mood Patterns app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is 256-bit AES encrypted. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","100,000+ downloads","Dec 9, 2019","May 29, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.moodpatterns.moodpatterns

"Welcome to Daily Affirmations Mirror, the ultimate app for improving your mental and emotional well-being. Designed to enhance your moral health, this app helps you recite, affirm, and read positive affirmations daily to reduce anxiety and stress and promote a healthy mindset.

You've probably heard the word ""affirmation"" more than once. Also, you probably heard the expression ""We are what we think"". Let's now figure out how this is connected. Daily affirmations are positive reminders or statements that can be used to encourage, affirm, and motivate yourself or others. They help purify our thoughts, motivation, mood, mental health and restructure the dynamic of our brains so that we truly begin to think nothing is impossible or become motivated. They are proven methods of self-improvement because of their ability to help to rewire our brains and mental health.

Since your thoughts play a big part in overall success, happiness, and motivation, it‚Äôs important to find ways to improve and affirm your mindset, self motivation, mood, and mental health. If you don‚Äôt, you risk falling into negative thought patterns or holding yourself back. Daily affirmations do indeed strengthen us by helping us believe in the potential of an action we desire to manifest, just as the law of attraction says.

Self-affirmation is the process of reminding yourself of the values and interests that constitute your true or core self. It‚Äôs taking stock of who you are and what you care about. It encourages you to think and affirm positively about the important things in life and about your mood.

The app's main feature is displaying affirmations on the screen, which are best recited aloud for maximum benefits. You can select from a variety of backgrounds to personalize your experience or use the front camera to have daily affirmations overlaid over your camera picture, like in the mirror, creating an innovative approach.

With multiple categories available, including health-focused daily affirmations, you can choose the perfect affirmation for any occasion or mood. The app also includes relaxing background music to keep you calm and focused.

Never forget to recite daily affirmations with the app's daily reminder feature, which sends you a positive reminder at a specific time throughout the day. You can also create your categories to affirm your own goals and add affirmations from other categories or your own personal collection.

Sleepers will have 4 or 5 sleep cycles during the night. Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when most dreaming happens) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.

Sleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.

üìà- Get Your Sleep Score
Sleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better. Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want a way to check how their sleep is, and do not want to invest in an accessory like a smart band or smartwatch.

‚è∞ - Set Smart Alarm Clock
Set an alarm for your morning wake-up or nap or set a reminder for bedtime.

üéµ- Listen to Soothing Lullabies
Suffering from insomnia? Listen to high-quality relaxing music to calm a racing mind before sleep. Fall asleep quickly with different kinds of sleep sounds.

‚úç - Write Sleep Notes
Take brief notes for your sleep. Write down anything you want so you will never forget about them.

"Join over 5 million users! Become a better sleeper and morning person thanks to 100 years of sleep science with RISE, the only sleep tracker that also measures your sleep debt and energy levels.


Recommended by the Sleep Foundation and trusted by teams in the NFL, MLB, and NBA, and top Fortune 500 companies, RISE makes it easy to improve your sleep and energy.


But RISE is more than a sleep and energy tracker. Users can access widgets, calendar integration, sleeping sounds, meditation guides, smart alarm clocks, habit reminders, and a sleep knowledge library.

FROM THE RISE COMMUNITY

***
Chase M.
""RISE helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.""

***
Becky G.
""I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.‚Ä® I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before RISE.""


UNLOCK BETTER SLEEP
Tired of the age-old ""eight hours of shut-eye"" advice? Go beyond buying a new mattress or pillow and discover the life-changing concept of Sleep Debt.

Scientifically proven to be a vital factor in your well-being, a low Sleep Debt can improve your life quality and even your longevity‚Äîwhile high Sleep Debt can cause fatigue and harm your health.

RISE calculates your Sleep Debt, helps you understand its impact on your energy, and guides you on how to lower it by improving sleeping habits. Learn about your melatonin window, when to prioritize sleep, and understand the real cost of those late nights‚Äîand how you can benefit from naps.

PERSONALIZED SLEEP TRACKER
Do you find your mind racing when your head hits the pillow? Can‚Äôt stop doom-scrolling on your phone? Feeling fatigued all day?

Based on your sleep data, circadian rhythm, and the latest research, we‚Äôll make recommendations that fit your needs and guide you toward healthier habits, making you a better sleeper.

RISE will get you in bed on time, guide you when you can‚Äôt sleep, reduce the times you wake up at night, and make you feel less groggy in the morning.

DISCOVER YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM
We all have an internal brain clock, our circadian rhythm, it signals to our body when to be alert or go into recovery mode. Everyone is unique, from when we perform our best to when we should sleep and wake up, so we use advanced algorithms to find your optimal sleep and activity window.

You‚Äôll gain insight into your circadian rhythm and daily energy levels, helping you plan for a more productive day.

Sleeping refuels energy, and 83% of RISE users feel more energy in a week or less.

AUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP
Through our integration with Apple Health, Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, and data from other sleep trackers on your phone, like Sleep Cycle and ShutEye, RISE can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, your sleep debt, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other activities that affect your sleep pattern.

WHY WE STARTED RISE
We want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we're experiencing, which has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).


Today, we look at sleep as a luxury. RISE strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.

Subscription pricing & terms
RISE offers auto-renewing subscriptions to provide unlimited access to all premium features. There‚Äôs also a limited-time free trial of 7 days to explore the premium features for free.

Payment will be charged to the credit card connected to your Play account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase.

"Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Are you sensitive to light during migraine?
Twilight may be a solution for you!

Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.

The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.

In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..

The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.

You can also use Twilight on your Wear OS device.

1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen

2) AMOLED screens: We have tested Twilight on an AMOLED screen for 5 years without any sign of depletion or over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) with more equal light distribution (dark areas of the screen such as the status bar get tinted). This may in fact increase your AMOLED screen life time.

Wear OS

Twilight also syncs your Wear OS screen with your phone's filter settings. You can control filtering from a ""Wear OS Tile"".

"WHAT IS LO√ìNA - Bedtime & Sleep Stories - ?
Lo√≥na is the first app that lets you take care of your mind and body wellness with the help of interactive coloring sessions, breathing exercises, relax melodies, positive affirmations, meditation, relaxing sleep games, sleep music and bedtime stories, all accompanied by soothing relax melodies including nature sounds, white noise, pink noise and brown noise to get you in the right mood to fall asleep soundly to relaxing music and beat anxiety and insomnia.

Features of Loona:
- Sleep Games
- Sleep Stories
- Bedtime Stories
- Music & Nature Sounds, Playlists

SO, IT'S ANOTHER APP TO HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP FAST, RIGHT?
Not exactly. Lo√≥na isn‚Äôt a list of direct ""go-to-sleep"" techniques that beats insomnia, but rather a soothing pod, a sleep aid or mood-altering app. Stay calm and relieve anxiety during the day by listening to ocean waves, wind sounds, and other relax melodies and prepare yourself to fall asleep easily in the evening with the help of sleepscape, bedtime stories, sleep music and coloring, soothing sounds and calming sleep games.

WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?
Negative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future making it hard to fall asleep. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood to sleep well.

HOW DOES LO√ìNA WORK?
From the wake up and during the busy day Lo√≥na will support your emotional states with playlists and calming immersive stories. Each night you‚Äôll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that bundles together CBT, activity-based relaxation, storytelling, sleep meditation and sleep sounds and sleep music uniquely. Complete it by stepping into the soothing pod to shut the frantic world out, relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood. Complete it by stepping into the soothing pod to shut the frantic world out, relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep. Focus on calming activities to stop ruminating and quiet your racing thoughts.

DOES IT BEAT INSOMNIA?
87% of Lo√≥na users reported improvement in sleep quality after 14 days of use. Escape sessions help users beat insomnia and fall asleep fast.


IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP MEDITATION or SLEEP APP?
Mastering sleep meditation techniques requires a lot of patience and time. Starting your Lo√≥na journey is as easy as playing a relaxing sleep game for just 15 minutes a day.

CAN I USE A PHONE BEFORE BED?
Lo√≥na uses dimmer, warmer colors that are less likely to suppress melatonin. While the session of coloring itself has been shown to have a calming effect and can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can also improve sleep quality and eventually beat insomnia.

Incorporating Lo√≥na into a bedtime routine helps decrease time spent on scrolling social networks. Because scrolling social networks before bedtime exposes you to bright screens and blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and interfere with your sleep-wake cycle.

What do you get:
- 70+ interactive sleepscape journeys and relaxing & bedtime games for sleeping
- immersive bedtime stories for adults
- calm down or focus with relax melodies & bedtime stories
- soothing sleep sounds like nature sounds including rain sounds and ocean waves, wind, brown noise or white noise and for tinnitus relief
- lullabies to help you put your kids to bed
- breathing exercises
- gentle alarm clock
- affirmations, motivational quotes and sleep meditation
- bedtime games

"Binaural Beats for improved sleep, focus and nature sounds for ambience.

Join over 400,000 users!
If you are looking to enhance your rest, relaxation, and concentration, our brain wave app can help you! Join more than 400,000 users who have benefited from the refreshing effects of binaural beats. You can begin to feel more relaxed and more focused, with less stress and anxiety, in just minutes.

What are Binaural Beats
They were first discovered in 1839 by German physicist Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. When two tones of slightly different frequencies are presented separately, one to each ear, the brain responds by creating a third tone, which is equal to the difference between the two frequencies.

Researchers have found that these brain waves are beneficial to a person in many ways, including by helping to improve your focus and concentration, lessening stress, calming your emotions, improving the quality of your sleep, and increasing your drive and energy.

Seamless Background Playback
Continue listening to binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies, ambient sounds, breathwork, and custom mixes while using other apps or when your screen is off. Easily control playback through the media notification - play, pause, or stop your audio without returning to the app. Just pause and swipe left on the notification to close the playback completely.

How to use Binaural Beats
Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Once you are settled, you will need to wear headphones and listen to the track for 30-60 minutes.This is because each ear needs to hear a different frequency in order for the binaural beat to be produced.

Isochronic Tones
Isochronic tones are an alternative brain wave type of technology to Binaural Beats and can be used without headphones. They work in a similar fashion, by entraining to different frequencies. However in the case of Isochronic Tones we listen to pulses of sounds at different frequencies, encouraging a certain brain wave state.

Ambient Sounds
Whether it's the sound of raindrops or the gentle crashing of waves against a shoreline, these ambient sounds can help you feel more calm and serene. In addition to promoting feeling good, ambient sounds can also help boost your concentration by blocking out external noise.

Breathwork
The benefits of breathwork are vast and well-documented. When we breathe deeply and slowly, it has a profound impact on the nervous system, helping to calm the mind and relax the body. Breathwork has also been shown to improve the quality of sleep, increase energy levels, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote overall well-being. Use our Breathwork techniques to improve your overall wellbeing.

Features:
- No network is required
- Over 100 pre-generated beats!
- Listen without headphones using isochronic tones
- Create your own custom Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma brainwaves
- Breathwork
- Solfeggio Frequencies
- Ambient Sounds
- Timer to automatically and smoothly fade out the sounds
- Background listening while using other apps
- Create your own brainwave playlists
- Noise Block

For best results
*Volume should ALWAYS be set at the lower side of a comfortable level.
*High volumes will NOT enhance the effects. .
*Use isochronic tones when trying to listen to these brain waves without headphones.
*Use ambient sounds to make the beats sound better.

Disclaimer
*Our app is NOT intended to treat or cure any form of disease.

"Avrora is the best sleep tracking app for those who would like to fall asleep easily and wake up energized with the help of special breathing techniques, mindfulness sessions, calming sounds‚Äìincluding white noise, nature sounds and sleep music‚Äì and refreshing alarm melodies.

‚≠êÔ∏è HOW AVRORA WORKS

‚≠êÔ∏è Falling Asleep:
Deep calm breathing combined with relaxing sleep music and sleep sounds leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows Avrora to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts and promoting better sleep. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sleep sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep.

‚≠êÔ∏è Sleep recording:
Our sleep tracker app is also a snore recorder and sleep recorder which helps you track snoring and other sleep habits, including sleep apnea.

‚≠êÔ∏è Sleep retention:
Breathing techniques results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation and mindfulness, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.

‚≠êÔ∏è Waking Up Refreshed:
After a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Our Smart Alarm analyzes your sleep patterns and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important for mental wellness to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.

‚≠êÔ∏è Sleep Sounds
Our sleep app offers a variety of nature sounds, sleep music, white noise, brown noise and pink noise options to choose from to ensure you can wind down from your stressful day, relieve anxiety and relax.

‚ùì Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?
‚ùì Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up?
‚ùì Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?
‚ùì Are you struggling to stay organized?

‚Ä¢ Pink Noise is balanced like rain sounds. We recommend pink noise for sleep and focus.

Do you struggle to sleep at night because of distracting sounds like traffic or a partner snoring? Noise Machine's sleep sounds mask these noises and help you sleep naturally. Brown noise and green noise are particularly effective sleep sounds. White noise can help with tinnitus management during sleep.

Noise Machine helps focus your mind in distracting environments. By replacing disruptive sounds with white noise, green noise, brown noise, or pink noise, the distractions are drowned out, leaving you in virtual silence. The noises calm and relax the mind, allowing you to focus and improve productivity. Try green noise and white noise for effective focus sounds.

The app sounds great on your phone and can also connect to headphones or speakers for deeper noise‚Äîno need to buy a physical sound machine. Brown noise, pink noise, and green noise sound especially rich on headphones and speakers.

"The Whispy Baby White Noise app will help fall asleep quickly to soothing and relaxing sounds!

Sometimes the child is naughty and nothing can help the parents to calm him down and put him to sleep. It also happens that the baby wakes up every 15 minutes or does not want to sleep in the crib. Perhaps the baby is too tired, but cannot fall asleep on its own - this often happens in newborns!

In the practice of many parents, we have learned that monotonous sounds (the so-called ""white noise""), for example, the clamor of a fan, vacuum cleaner, are more effective as a lullaby for a child's sleep than music or singing.

Also, the baby falls asleep better (as he calms down) to the sounds outside the window, the sound of the rain or the uproar of the street. Sleep becomes deeper, its quality improves. When using white noise, the newborn does not wake up every 20 minutes, which also allows the mother to rest better.

What if there are no such sounds? Our application can make different tones that have a positive effect on the child's sleep:

- rain
- fan
- hairdryer
- air conditioning
- ""mom sounds"" - ch-ch-ch, motion sickness
- ""in my mother's womb""
- wind
- sea, forest, and other sounds of nature
- animal sounds
- train, car, plane, subway

This app helps the child to calm down, speeds up the time to fall asleep. In the studies conducted, most infants were able to fall asleep to white noise within five minutes, while without it, 25 percent of newborns fell asleep during the same time.
The app blocks outside noises that might wake your baby up. Sleep associations have been created that signal the baby to sleep and help him feel safe even in unfamiliar surroundings.

Application features:

- Over 80 ringtones
- Loop playback without stops
- Timer with smooth start and fade out
- Background playback - you can use other applications during playback. You can set a timer, switch to background mode, or turn off the screen. After the time expires, the sound will be smoothly turned off, the application will be closed.
- Work offline without the Internet
- Night mode
- Unlimited playtime helps sleep longer

The premium version of the app contains more useful features such as:

- extended library of tones
- unlimited offline time
- unlimited mixes
- no ads in the app

As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don‚Äôt even have to work for it.

The more you read and save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.

Build and organize your knowledge

You can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.

Search and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.

Share your knowledge

Add your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.

Share your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this.

This application is designed for all children and adults who have difficulties in articulating some phonemes. In addition to going to speech therapy, this application provides important support, to do at home, with images and fun games. This encourages the generalization of phonemes in speech, and therefore a more rapid and effective evolution.

The application is designed for both children and adults, who need and want to improve their articulation, and can also work on attention and memory exercises at the same time.

The speech therapy application contains 18 sounds, but compound sounds have also been added, so that a total of 29 different sounds can be worked on (B, BL, BR, CL,CR, D,F,FL,FR, G, GL,GR,CH, J, K, L, LL, M, N, P, PL,PR,R, RR, S, T, TR,DR,Z).

The application contains a large number of varied and selected images to work on all phonemes with fun. It is important that at home parents can accompany the work with this application, and thus strengthen the work done with the speech therapist.
This application is designed to accompany the work of speech therapy sessions. Thus, the therapist has support of images of all the phonemes as well as games that make the work more attractive for children.
The application has been developed with the collaboration of the speech therapist Beatriz Ibarra Benedicto.


- These exercises do not replace speech therapy sessions. Using the application helps you practice at home, in an entertaining and motivating way. It is important that a family member is present while the children are with the application.

- Before starting the exercises in this application, the child must be able to say the sound alone and also say it in simple syllables. The exercises and games in this application help articulation in more complex words.

- If you are not sure what to do, consult a speech therapist.","50,000+ downloads","Feb 23, 2019","Jun 19, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.logopedia.es1

"Pelvic floor muscles play an important role in many aspects of our physical health, including bladder control, sexual function, and overall core stability. Kegel exercises are a simple, yet effective way to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. These exercises are beneficial for both men and women, and can be done discreetly and easily as part of a daily workout routine.

The pelvic floor muscles are located in the base of the pelvis and support the organs in the abdominal cavity. Weak pelvic floor muscles can lead to issues such as urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and sexual dysfunction. Kegel exercises can help to strengthen and tone the pelvic floor muscles, which can improve overall function and reduce the risk of these issues.

Kegel exercises can be done by both men and women, and are simple to perform. To do a Kegel exercise, find the right muscles by trying to stop the flow of urine while using the toilet. Once you've identified the right muscles, you can do Kegels by squeezing and holding the muscles for 5 seconds and then relaxing for 5 seconds. Repeat this process 10-15 times, working up to 3 sets per day.

It's important to note that proper form is crucial when doing Kegel exercises. Make sure to focus on engaging the pelvic floor muscles, rather than the abdominal or thigh muscles. It's also important to breathe normally and avoid holding your breath during the exercises.

Kegel exercises can be done anywhere and at any time, making them easy to incorporate into your daily routine. You can do them while sitting at your desk, standing in line at the grocery store, or even while watching TV.

In addition to Kegel exercises, you can also incorporate other exercises that target the pelvic floor muscles such as squats, bridges, lunges, and deadlifts. These exercises can help to engage and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, and can be done as part of a regular workout routine.

It's important to note that while Kegel exercises are beneficial, they should not be done instead of other physical activity. A well-rounded workout plan that includes cardio, strength training, and stretching is important for overall health.

In conclusion, Kegel exercises are a simple and effective way to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which can improve overall function and reduce the risk of issues such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. These exercises can be done discreetly and easily as part of a daily workout routine, and are beneficial for both men and women. Incorporate other exercises that target the pelvic floor muscles and make sure to have a well-rounded workout plan for overall health.","100,000+ downloads",Fitric,"Nov 22, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.fitric.pelvicfloor

"Do you know

When you are happy?
When you feel excited?
When you are sad?
When you are angry?
When you feel anxious?

Most people don't really understand their own emotions.

Because they don't know,

They can't fully enjoy moments of happiness,
And they are deeply hurt in difficult times.

When exciting moments come to you, recognize them and fully experience them.
Such moments don't come often.

These memories enrich your life.

Increase happy events,
Decrease sad ones,

And create a happier life.

"Therapeer: A private emotional support team focused on helping YOU.
Support others emotionally and improve your own emotional well-being.

Get private peer support coping with marriage problems, divorce, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other matters related to your emotional well-being.

Therapeer is for adults 18 years and older only.

WHAT'S THERAPEER?
‚Ä¢ As a PEER you can help other community members seeking emotional support via private group chat.
‚Ä¢ As a HOST you can open your own private Support Room, where 3 experienced Peers will join and focus solely on supporting you in your time of need.
‚Ä¢ Earn kudos when providing support as a Peer, to use towards your very own private Support Room, FREE OF CHARGE.
‚Ä¢ Therapeer is completely ANONYMOUS. You are never asked for your real name and we‚Äôll never disclose your personal information.
‚Ä¢ A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.


WHY USE THERAPEER?
You're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.
Yes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.
Yes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don‚Äôt always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.
Yes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don‚Äôt want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.
But most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.

We get all of that. We get YOU.


HOW DOES IT WORK?
‚Ä¢ Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.
‚Ä¢ Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).
‚Ä¢ After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing. Peer assignment is based on your personal preferences and on the topic being discussed.

Join Therapeer today! Transform your struggles into strength, support people in need, and improve your own emotional well-being.

CONNECT WITH US!
Feel free to contact us anytime with your questions, comments, and suggestions. We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

This world is dying.

Hundreds of years ago, Dissolution came with no signs. Life, consciousness, memories...All the existence that humans once gave meaning to were erased by Dissolution.

Yet people were kept in the dark.

"The urge to self-harm is like a wave. It feels the most powerful when you start wanting to do it.

Join over 2 million users and learn to ride the wave with the free Calm Harm app by choosing activities from these categories: Comfort, Distract, Express Yourself, Release, and Random.

There is also a breathing technique to help be mindful and stay in the moment, regulate difficult emotions and reduce tension.

When you ride the wave, the urge to self-harm will fade.

Calm Harm is an award-winning app developed for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Clinical Psychologist Dr. Nihara Krause, in collaboration with young people, using principles from the evidence-based Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). It is built to NHS standards and approved by ORCHA.

Calm Harm provides some immediate techniques to help break the cycle of self-harm behaviours and explore underlying trigger factors; build a ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô of helpful thoughts, behaviours and access to supportive people; and provides the opportunity to journal and self-reflect. It also provides signposts to help.

The Calm Harm app is private, anonymous and safe.

Please note that the Calm Harm app is not a substitute for the assessment and individualised treatment by a health/mental health professional.

Please also note that if you forget both your passcode and security answer, these cannot be reset as we do not create user accounts. You will need to reinstall the app, losing any previous data.

Calm Harm has been given a new look and updated to the latest technology. We‚Äôve listened to users and enhanced the app‚Äôs functionality, adding the ability to make journal entries at any time and the option to select multiple reasons for your urge to self-harm after completing an activity. We‚Äôve also updated and expanded the choice of activities based on user suggestions.

What else is new?
‚Ä¢ Users can add activities to a ‚ÄòFavourites‚Äô list.
‚Ä¢ The mascots are now enhanced by animations throughout the app.
‚Ä¢ Choose from a wider selection of colour schemes.
‚Ä¢ Easier access to immediate help via the breathe activity, both during onboarding and in the footer of the app itself.
‚Ä¢ We‚Äôve removed the option to set a passcode to access the whole app and, instead, the self-monitoring section can now be passcode-protected or accessed via facial recognition / Touch ID.
‚Ä¢ Tours explaining key features of the app.

What is staying the same?
‚Ä¢ The app is clinically-developed by a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in collaboration with young people.
‚Ä¢ Optional passcode-protection (though now only for the self-monitoring section).
‚Ä¢ Users choose 5-minute or 15-minute activities (from the same categories as before), counted down by a timer, that are based on the principles of a treatment technique called Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).
‚Ä¢ Users can still record experiences in the log section (now called My Records) and see information such as weekly average urge strength, most common urges, and most active time of day.
‚Ä¢ The app is completely free, with no in-app purchases required.
‚Ä¢ Users are shown signposts to further help.
‚Ä¢ Our commitment to data privacy and user anonymity.
‚Ä¢ No need for data or WiFi access to use the app.
‚Ä¢ Built to UK National Health Service standards and approved by ORCHA.

"The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.

The module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.

The module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only ‚Äì switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚Äöbox breathing‚Äò technique‚Äì full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.

Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)

The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).

The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‚Äòs life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.

In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again ‚Äì the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.

In the last module ‚Äì PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES ‚Äì there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.

"Be Ceremonial offers you hundreds of universal rituals to choose from and a unique framework that guides you through the process of creating your own ceremony. Our app helps you acknowledge the significant moments that surround life, death, and the moments in between.

- Choose from hundreds of secular and universal rituals
- Create your own ceremonies that span the life cycle, with a focus on grief, loss and legacy.

A ritual is an intentional, symbolic action that hopes to create meaning. A ceremony is a series of rituals that can help you process an experience, acknowledge a transition, or honor a rite of passage. We believe that ritual and ceremony can change how you live your life.

Being ceremonial means acknowledging your entire well-being, including your physical, emotional, and mental wellness. With a focus on mindfulness and intentional living, we draw from universal examples and therapeutic techniques to craft and curate our rituals.

WHAT IS BE CEREMONIAL?

Be Ceremonial is the world‚Äôs first guided ritual platform that empowers you to create your own ceremonies or perform daily rituals. We help you create rituals and ceremonies that are meaningful to you.

We offer ceremonies that span the life cycle; from birth to death to the many moments in between, we want to help you recognize the visible and invisible moments of change this life can bring. From fertility to pregnancy loss, divorce to menopause, a cancer diagnosis to a death anniversary, there are so many moments across the life cycle that deserve to be ritualized.

INSIDE THE APP

Inside the Be Ceremonial app, you can choose from our list of curated daily rituals, create a larger life ceremony, and learn how to become more ceremonial with our tutorials, workshops and virtual events.

You can sign up for a free basic account, giving you a taste of what we offer, you can purchase a single ceremony if you have a specific need, or you can start a subscription to unlock all the daily rituals, create unlimited ceremonies, and access free workshops and events.

How it started:
Positive Mental Training was first used within the NHS for patients with low mood, stress and depression and we soon found that it was also being used by the doctors and nurses for their own benefit too. It can help with all life stresses, including burnout and sleep problems.

The tracks in Sorted began with the 12 track Positive Mental Training audio CDs, when Dr Alastair Dobbin, a GP and Dr Sheila Ross, a ancadapted a Swedish Olympic Sports performance programme, drawn to its positive self-development focus. Since then research has demonstrated its ability to build good psychological functioning, as well as recovery from depression and anxiety. The App is used within the NHS by staff and patients, in many colleges and universities for staff and students and recommended in Public Health England ‚ÄòEvery Mind Matters‚Äô campaign, for NHS health and social care staff across Scotland.

We are working on making the Sorted mental health app as accessible as possible so everyone can use the app. Our accessibility statement:

"BleKip is an app which can keep the device awake, showing a black screen on the display. It keeps the apps running and videos playing, while reducing the battery consumed by the screen.

Usefulness and core fuctionalities of this app:

(1) Keep the device awake, when needed:

When the device's screen is off, it goes to sleep mode. It transfers work to low-power CPU cores and reduce network capabilities. It can also stops background tasks anytime. This sleep mode can save the battery. But in some cases, we may need to keep the device awake for the critical tasks.
For example :
(a) While downloading the large files which may fail if the device goes to sleep mode.
(b) While playing videos in the apps which can't continue playback if the screen is off.
(c) While performing CPU-demanding tasks, and while loading large critical content in the apps; which should not be stopped or slowed down when the screen goes off.

BleKip can help in such situations. BleKip keeps the display on and the device awake, while showing a black screen on display with lowest level of brightness.

(2) Save battery consumed by the screen:

When it is required to keep the screen on for long period of time, BleKip can help reduce the battery consumed by the screen.
(a) For OLED displays: OLED display does not consume battery while showing a full black screen.
(b) For non-OLED displays: Battery is saved by setting the the screen brightness to its lowest possible level.

(3) Prevents burn-in on OLED screen:

Displaying a static content on OLED screen for very-very long period of time, can cause permanent burn-in. When it is required to keep the screen on for long period of time in order to keep the device fully awake, BleKip can help preventing the burn-in on OLED screen. BleKip shows a full black screen on display, all the pixel are turned off. which prevents burn-in.

‚ÄúIncredible results. Using this app genuinely helped me get to a far better place with my mental health when I found myself at the most difficult time of my life. It gave me the strength & ability to move forward. I can not recommend it enough‚Äù

[Incredible Tool - iOS user] - *****
I‚Äôm someone who is accustomed to burying my head in the sand when it comes to my mental health and allowing my thoughts to spiral to the depths of the deepest bogs. Whilst I have tentatively tried other apps and tools, nothing has seemed to help with my continuous cycle of struggle. This app has given me the vital tools to retrain my mind to slow down and halt the downward spiral and instead find a way to bring me back to a place of calm and comfort. There is a sense of self-care and empowerment, knowing I am taking control of my mental health and although I am doing it by myself, I never feel alone in my journey.

You need to dedicate a small amount of time to it (in the grand scheme of things) but you will get results. It‚Äôs the small wins that amount to the big ones and Ed can Help is really helping my mindset to shift for the better, bringing with it a new sense of calm.

"It's natural to feel afraid during and after a shocking, scary, or life-threatening event. Most people who experience traumatic events may have difficulty adjusting at first but eventually get back to their normal routines. If you continue to feel distressed long after the traumatic event has occurred, you may have PTSD.

This app is designed to evaluate your symptoms of PTSD with a scientifically-supported 20-question screening test. It uses the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a screening questionnaire for PTSD that is often used in healthcare and research settings. The PCL-5 is also helpful for monitoring your PTSD-related symptoms during and after treatment.

PTSD Test contains four tools:
- Start Test: take the PCL-5 to assess your PTSD symptoms
- History: see a history of your test scores to monitor your symptoms over time
- Information: learn about PTSD and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery
- Reminder: set up notifications to re-take the test at your convenience

Disclaimer: The PCL-5 is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. Please consult a physician or mental health professional if you are concerned about PTSD.¬†

"Injuries are far too common in many sports. For an athlete, being injured can be devastating, and even end a promising career. However, injuries can be prevented. Numerous scientific studies have proven that structured warm-up exercises can reduce the risk of injuries by over 50%!

Get Set ‚Äì Train smarter was created to coincide with the 2014 and 2016 Youth Olympic
Games in Nanjing, China, and in Lillehammer, Norway, and is the result of a collaboration
between the International Olympic Committee, the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center,
several Norwegian and international sports federations, and Making Waves AS.

The target group is not only the young talents and their coaches, but anyone engaged in
physical activity. Get Set ‚Äì Train smarter was created to help prevent sports injuries by
providing the most effective and evidence-based workout routines for your needs.

All exercises are presented through videos, supported by short descriptions on how to
perform the exercise correctly. Exercises are presented with variations as well as 3 levels to make them more difficult and challenging as you progress. The Get Set exercises are
designed to be carried out with a minimum of equipment, to make them safe and easy to
implement wherever you are.

Under ‚ÄúSport‚Äù, you will find your sport among the 40 summer and 15 winter sports, and as
another option you can find injury prevention exercises targeting specific body parts. In
other words, for each of the 55 sports, the exercise program is tailored to the injury risk
profile of the sport. Likewise, under ‚ÄúBody‚Äù, you will find exercises developed to prevent
problems with the shoulder, back, groin, hamstring, knee, and ankle.

You can download all the exercise programs as PDF files with small pictures and short
descriptions to help you remember. The PDF can be printed or shared electronically with
your teammates, coaches, friends and family.

Get Set is available on iOS and Android in 9 languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian,
German, Norwegian, Chinese, Korean and Finnish), and is accessible for free.

The first time you view an exercise, the app will download the video to your device. For this we
recommend using a wifi connection, to be sure external charges are not applied. Once you
have downloaded the exercise videos on your mobile phone, they are stored on your device,
allowing you to benefit from Get Set wherever you are.

"Rewire stress-based behaviors at the root of your chronic symptoms, release inherited & stored trauma responses, & gently guide your nervous system back to a place of safety, regulation, and genuine ease.

What if healing is allowed to be easy? What if it can feel more like play?

Tapping with T is both a community of self healers and a playground of tools intended to support you in rewiring your brain and is ultimately here to assist you in healing yourself.

With a weekly-updated library of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) tapping videos, breathwork, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, and guided relaxations, Tapping with T supports you to regulate at your own pace. We host group calls every 5-6 weeks to integrate and deepen your self-paced healing practice as we question & shake off old stories collectively.

The community forum is a space to ask questions, make video requests, share reflections, get updates, and ultimately to serve as a reminder that we get to heal and grow together. We were never meant to do this alone and we don't have to. Together, we learn to release what is weighing us down, step into new possibilities, and widen our windows of tolerance with tenderness!

Videos range in length from 5-25 minutes. We cover a wide range of topics including:

~Handling anxiety: about being chronically ill, having food reactions & flare-ups, panic attacks, social events, not being able to sleep, etc.

~Honoring depression: using parts work to see low energy states as opportunities to lean in, learning to move through & release emotions with curiosity.

~Confidence & Body-image: for unwanted weight-gain, unwanted weight-loss, acne, body-acceptance, binge-eating, people-pleasing, and releasing the worry about what people might think.

~Sleep support: for those with insomnia or panic, night sweats, waking up exhausted, brain fog, healing while you sleep, etc.

~Energy support: for chronic fatigue, PMS, fibromyalgia, MCAS, exercise, burn-out, etc.

~Releasing fear: around never getting better, feeling behind, feeling disabled by symptoms, not knowing the next step to take to heal, and more.

~Chronic symptom support: for Lyme & infections, mold, gut disorders, pain, PTSD, food sensitivities, fatigue, sadness, etc.

~Relationship support: for boundaries, communication, finding love, connection.

~Releasing trapped emotions: for healing physical symptoms related to anger, grudges, grief, etc.

~Pregnancy & Postpartum: TTC, depression & fatigue, & traumatic birth experiences.

~Our videos target those with complex cases of chronic illness & trauma wanting to feel grounded, hopeful, and healthy again.

With each tap, we step out of limbic loops, lower stress, and allow the body to heal & favor continual growth.

"Are you feeling stressed, not quite yourself, or worried about a loved one? iChill is here to help. iChill teaches six wellness skills from the Trauma Resiliency Model (TRM)¬Æ and Community Resiliency Model (CRM)¬Æ to help you manage sensations associated with trauma and stress, enhancing your well-being.

Based on the biology of the human nervous system, iChill helps us understand and regulate our body's natural rhythms. When in harmony, our nervous system aids in navigating life's challenges, helping us make sound decisions for ourselves and our community. This balanced state is called the Resilient Zone or ""Okay Zone.""

Stressful events can bump us into the High Zone (anxious, uptight) or Low Zone (numb, disconnected). iChill helps us return to our Okay Zone, restoring balance. Regular practice of these skills can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, improving overall well-being. iChill benefits children, teens, and adults of all ages. It helps us answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat else is true?‚Äù leaning into our strengths to help manage distress in the present moment.
