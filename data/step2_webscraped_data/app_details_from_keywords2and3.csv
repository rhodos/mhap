"Shimmer provides 'bite sized' ADHD coaching to people with ADHD or executive function challenges. Shimmer was born from a group of ADHD coaches, psychiatrists, doctors, and engineers to create a personalized, ACTION-oriented playground for you and your coach to explore.

We're not another list, calendar, or app: we're REAL human interactions paired with expert strategies and experimentation, so that you can make real changes in your life. Oh, and we also have ADHD too!

Shimmer is for people with ADHD or struggling with executive function challenges. We’re for those who are ready to make a change and take real action to reach their goals. We’re for those ready to put in the work. Typically our members fall into 3 categories:

1. are newly diagnosed or looking to understand their ADHD better: we provide psycho-education and guidance for you to understand ADHD & how it impacts your life
2. have concrete executive function skills they’d like to improve on and are looking for guidance to follow through: we provide the critical knowledge, resources, guidance, support, and accountability so that you actually implement the changes (routines, skills, tools) that will help you reach your goals
3. know they can achieve more and aren’t living at their potential: we use an ACT-based methodology to help you identify your values and help you live in line with them

Our ADHD coaches partner with you to co-design a plan to achieve your goals. You'll experiment with strategies on a weekly basis to implement a routine fit specifically for YOU. Our program has been designed off science-backed methods in partnership with NYU, UC Berkeley, and UCSF.

- Attend weekly 1:1 check-ins with your coach
- Personalized plan each week catered to you
- Experiment with tailored skills, strategies, and routines
- Text-based accountability check-ins throughout the week from your coach
- Learn ADHD skills and tips through bite-sized learning modules

The biggest value we’ve heard from our members are:

- An expert ADHD coach that knows ADHD inside out and understands them
- An accountability partner to hold them to what they said they’d do
- Someone to help them break down big tasks to feel less overwhelmed
- Guidance to navigate the sea of content and resources out there
- Personalized positive reinforcement, support and celebration of the little things
- Weekly cadence to make baby steps for changes in their life
- An affordable alternative to traditional ADHD coaching that fits into their life

Our coaches are specialized in taking an ADHD-adapted approach to coaching and are skilled at helping you navigate life’s ups and downs. Not sure if you’re in the right place? Our members come to use and are working on:

- Understanding their ADHD
- Feeling they’re not living up to their full potential
- Goal setting & habit building
- Creating routines & schedules
- Feelings of overwhelm, paralysis, and inability to turn brain off
- Issues with self-esteem and negative self-talk
- Inability to focus during working hours
- Holding themselves accountable to changes, challenging “excuse” thoughts
- Task initiation
- Being more productive

Most of our members have ADHD but you don’t need to be formally diagnosed to use Shimmer. We help all sorts of individuals with ADHD-related symptoms like executive function challenges, goal-setting, and living a fuller life!

"RoutineFlow is an ADHD planner and organizer that puts your success on autopilot by building a consistent daily routine with you. With this routine timer you can not only create a morning routine but organize your schedule for the entire week.

See for yourself using a smart routine timer can be a game-changer for managing ADHD or autism. Five reasons for why you should use an ADHD planner:

1. Get more done by tracking your routine every day
2. Establish powerful routines that stick even if you have ADHD as an adult
3. Wake up excited by having a morning routine
4. Stop ADHD procrastination with guided routine playlists
5. Having an ADHD planner helps you stay on track for your routine

Create a routine with a timer for each task. Quickly enter flow state or ADHD hyperfocus and get in the zone while completing your morning routine. If you are doing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), RoutineFlow is useful for establishing a simple routine.

According to Atomic Habits, routines are context dependent, especially if you have ADHD. That’s why RoutineFlow helps you build on existing good habits and overwrites bad habits by setting a context for each routine. You always know what’s happening before your routine, which is really important for your focus.
This is even more true if you have problems as an adult with ADHD without a planner for your daily habits.

To help neurodivergent folks or those with ADHD & autism, we also gamify the process of completing a routine by using an immersive timer, so you can challenge yourself to race the clock.

When starting to use this app for building a routine to manage ADHD or to manage autism, there are tons of templates available, like a morning routine or a study routine. Tailored ADHD routines are planned for the future. Choose one of the templates or start from scratch by creating a custom routine.

Features:
-AI Task Breakdown for ADHD and autism
-A beautiful visual ADHD planner for your week
-Track every habit or routine you have
-Create multi-step habits, for example a morning routine
-Beat ADHD adult related problems with gamification
-Assign a timer and an emoji to each task
-Get notified whenever it is time to complete a routine
-No more getting distracted even if you have ADHD
-Finish each task laser focused with a timer
-Visualize your habit progress with beautiful statistics
-Analytics for time blindness if you have ADHD
-Clean dark mode

I’m an ADHD solo developer building apps, not a big company. That’s why it’s super motivating for me to hear from you, if you like my ADHD organizer. Simply reach out at thomas@routineflow.app.

"Hey friend! Welcome to Llama Life! Llama Life is designed to help you focus on ONE thing at a time (single-tasking), and to provide just a liiitle more structure (but not too much) to get things done.

We know you’ve been waiting (thank you!) and we’re super excited to bring our community the mobile app, to help you get through your tasks in the fun, whimsical way, that you know and love. It’s the same tool as the desktop version but adapted for mobile so you can have Llama Life on the go.

HOW DOES LLAMA LIFE WORK?

If you’re new here, a big warm hug! (Anddd, where have you been?!)

Llama Life let’s you set a countdown timer on *every* task. This concept is called ‘timeboxing’, and the idea is to create a (positive) constraint around the time we have to do something. The goal is to try and give a task 100% of our attention, until the timer runs out. This helps to increase focus, and gives us the mental space to think about ONE thing at a time.

Llama Life also let’s you know your total List Time, and the estimated finishing time, so you can be more aware of time passing, and plan your day.
We also love celebrating the wins, big or small, so very importantly, you get confetti (woo hoo!) when you finish a task. You can also personalize with color and emoji to get lots of variety and keep things fresh!

Llama Life offers a 7-day free trial, with a Monthly or Annual subscription.

We’re so glad you’re here, and are rooting for your success!

Let’s go!

Your Llama Life team, and productivity besties,

"Doing more things with your time. Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.That and more is what you can do with TimeTune, your schedule planner and time blocking app.👍 RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTSJessica McCabe from “How to ADHD” recommends TimeTune as an ideal tool to build solid routines and give structure to your day.😀 WHAT IS TIMETUNE?TimeTune is a schedule planner and time blocking app. Use it to organize your agenda, plan routines and increase your productivity.Do you know why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?The answer is that they have a very structured distribution of time. They organize their agenda with a planner and have strong time management habits. That allows them to seize the day and complete their tasks.With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can do the same.👩‍🔧 HOW DOES IT WORK?TimeTune uses time blocks to build your agenda. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine or a timetable.Templates allow you to plan upcoming schedules, routines, timetables or work shifts in a flash. You will enjoy an automated agenda.TimeTune Schedule Planner also shows you statistics to see where the time goes. Check them to see if your time is correctly structured and how you can improve.You can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don’t forget your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, custom sounds, voice, etc (ideal if you have ADHD).With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need. This daily planner will allow you to finally complete your tasks and save time.🤓 WHY DOES IT WORK?Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. If you add statistics, you get the perfect time management system to optimize your productivity.A structured day increases focus and motivation. Time blocking on a daily planner allows you to concentrate on the task at hand and avoid distractions.As Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” states:“Time blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure”It’s no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method and used a daily planner to organize their agenda in a structured way.Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking can be a crucial approach to tackle their agenda and avoid anxiety. If you have ADHD, TimeTune Schedule Planner allows you to focus on each task, improve your daily routine and see where the time actually goes.🤔 WHAT CAN I DO WITH TIMETUNE?With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can:★ Increase your focus and productivity★ Organize your agenda and reach your goals★ Improve your time management skills★ Plan your daily routine★ Set routines, timetables and work shifts★ Have a structured agenda★ Use it as your daily planner and routine planner★ Remove routine tasks from other calendars★ Analyze your time and discover time leaks★ Add custom reminders (ideal for ADHD)★ Free up time for yourself★ Organize your life with a better work/life balance★ Avoid anxiety and burnout★ Do everything in your agenda★ Do tasks in time if you have ADHD🙋 WHO IS IT FOR?If you would like to do more things with your time, TimeTune Schedule Planner is for you.Users with ADHD also tell us that TimeTune helps them a lot with their schedule and use the app as their routine manager.

"Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.Getting started with multi-factor authenticationMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.Getting started with passwordlessUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.Microsoft personal, work or school accountsSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.Optional Access permissions: Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions.

"Welcome to Obsessed!

It's not just an app; it's a comforting & insightful space that's all yours, to help you face your specific fears in a targeted way. Get ready for a streamlined, powerful approach to healing from OCD that's unlike anything you've experienced before.

Based on Cutting-Edge Neuroscience

While the word ‘neuroscience’ can be tossed around as a buzzword, Obsessed is aligned with how the brain really works. Designed by an OCD researcher, the Obsessed Technique is split into four stages, comprising over 790+ professional audio sessions: Learn, Prepare, Desensitize and Feel Great.
Together, these help you rewire the brain circuitry that keeps you fixated on specific topics in an efficient way.

Precise Exposure-Based Interventions = Freedom from OCD

OCD affects 2–3% of individuals, yet it can take up to 17 years for many people to receive effective treatment. Medication alone typically provides only moderate relief, because true recovery requires precise, targeted exposure
•Are you constantly bracing for worst-case scenarios?
•Do you attempt to expose yourself to your fears but remain anxious?
•Do you sometimes feel improvements, but slip back to the same pattern?

You’re perfectly normal. You just haven’t learned how to show your brain that your thoughts and anxious feelings don’t matter. When you fear these as well as the triggers, you stay stuck in a self-reinforcing loop. By learning how to undo the vicious cycle, you achieve genuine, lasting change.

Many Themes, Same Underlying Pattern

In the app, you’ll find almost every OCD theme under the sun. Here are just a few:
•Popular: Relationship OCD, Harm OCD, Checking OCD, Sensorimotor OCD, HOCD, POCD, Contamination OCD, Legal OCD, Just Right OCD, Religious OCD, Data OCD
•Rarer: Music Obsession OCD, Manifestation OCD, Existential OCD, True Nature OCD, Depression OCD
•OCD-like conditions: DPDR, Agoraphobia, Fear of Missing Out(FOMO) & many more

Obsessed guides you through exposure-response-prevention (ERP), but in a novel, more efficient way. First, you’ll identify your specific core fears – your ‘worst nightmare outcomes’. ""Every problem contains within itself the seeds of its own solution” - Norman Vincent Peale
Then, you’ll access an abundance of material teaching you how to PROVE to your brain that these fears aren’t real threats. OCD is stubborn, and your brain needs real evidence to heal!

Tap into New, Uplifting Emotional States

A common trap is to think, “I’ll be happy when I’m better!”. Really, you need to start cultivating positive emotions right now.

Why? Our brains have evolved to keep us alive by preserving energy. And, establishing new neural pathways requires energy. To encourage your brain to rewire itself, you must show it that you’re committed to chasing new, more positive feelings.

To make this effortless, we’ve curated pep talks, beautiful meditations, hypnosis sessions, and your own private journal designed to help you:
-Gain momentum
-Trust yourself, others & your mind’s capacity to heal
-Construct a new self-concept
-Celebrate & document your daily life/epic adventures alike
-Maintain your progress!

We’re Always Responding to Your Feedback

To make Obsessed as helpful as possible for you. Expect new themes, fresh content, and even more features as we grow. Plus, we promise to remain wholly grounded in science. Our material mirrors the most robust findings from neuroscience, and will consistently integrate future insights from reputable sources.

Start Conquering Your Unique Triggers – for Real This Time

Much of Obsessed is free, ready for you to enjoy now and forever. And our premium content is only 13.99 USD/£8.99/9.99 EUR per month. It contains 650+ high-quality audio sessions, meditations & exposures, split across 32 different OCD themes… letting you confront your fears while making the most of life.

"**Please note, a subscription to Primal's 3D Real-Time Human Anatomy software is required to use this application.**

Primal's 3D Real-time Human Anatomy app for the Foot is the ultimate 3D interactive anatomy viewer for all medical educators, practitioners and students. Meticulously built over ten years from high-resolution cross-sectional photographs of real cadavers, the app provides an accurate and visually stunning reconstruction of the anatomy of the foot.

The easy to use and intuitive interface lets you choose precisely the anatomy you want to see, from exactly the angle you want to see it. This flexibility is supported by a wealth of user-friendly tools to help you set up your ideal anatomical image, quickly and easily:

• The Gallery contains 13 pre-set scenes, designed by an in-house team of anatomical experts, to clearly and comprehensibly present in-depth regional and systemic anatomy of the foot. Each scene is divided into five layers to provide greater control over the depth of anatomy shown; making tailoring the anatomy you want to see simple and quick.

• The Contents folders arrange all 499 structures systemically, meaning you can browse by subcategory and switch all related structures on at once. It provides an excellent learning tool – for example turn on all branches of the lateral tarsal artery, or the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg.

• The Contents layer controls split each system into five layers – from deep to superficial. This allows you to quickly build up different systems to the depth you want to see.

Save the views you create for later in the Favourites, save anything as an image, or share with another user as a URL link. Use the pins, labels and drawing tools to customize your images for enlivened presentations, engaging course materials and handouts – all from your Android device!

Read detailed and accurate text for each structure using the T icon, and in a feature unique to Primal Pictures, each anatomical term in the text is linked to the appropriate model in the 3D model. Selecting these links will highlight the relevant structures, bringing the text to life and make learning anatomy more visual and immediate.

About OMBE Surf

OMBE is surf coaching and training methodology that stands for Ocean, Mind, Body and Equipment.

It is an approach with a focus on syncing all four major aspects within your surfing. When all four are in sync, your surfing will improve and you will easily enter a flow state within the ocean.

Most surfers will focus on their equipment first and expect an immediate improvement in their surfing but there is an order to OMBE and a reason for it.

You first must pay attention to the ocean and what it is doing, then calm your mind, relax and remove tension, as well as understanding how to do the manoeuvres, then you give your body the chance to effectively do the manoeuvre and your focus is on removing tension in the body and doing it more effortlessly. The board will either amplify or mute your movements and then it is a case of right tool for the job.

Each Boost Fin comes with a pre-set mode. But you don’t have to agree to the ordinary and can change the game and adjust the Fin to meet your needs!

Choose the amount of motor thrust for any moment of your session!
- Choose the duration of the boosts. There are two options of the boosts - Short boost and Long boost. Each Boost Fin comes with a pre-set mode, but you can change the duration of the boosts according to your needs and adjust the motor power for each one of them.

"Welcome to the SiS app! This smoking cessation app is designed for people who smoke less than daily. “SiS” stands for “Smiling instead of Smoking” - the app uses a positive psychology approach to support you in quitting smoking. Smoking is dangerous for everyone, even for people who smoke less than daily. Smoking as few as 6-10 cigarettes per month can substantially impact your health.

The app was designed by scientists based on existing evidence and clinical guidelines regarding smoking cessation [https://cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/clearing-the-air]. The research informing this app was funded by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute.

Each day, the app gives you specific tasks. These tasks introduce you to the app’s tools. Each task is timed specifically with regards to your chosen quit day, so that each day the app gives you the task most relevant to you that day. For best results, we recommend using the app every day for 7 weeks: for the 1 week leading up to your chosen quit day (prep work is important!), and the 6 weeks following your quit day.

Each day, the app will ask you to:
- Complete a happiness exercise
- Log your cigarettes – or confirm that you were smoke free
- Complete a specific task using one of the app’s tools; these tasks include, for example, specifying your personal reasons for quitting smoking, browsing strategies to overcome your smoking triggers, learning about benefits of quitting smoking, practicing resisting the urge to smoke, seeing how much money you saved by not smoking, etc.

Why work on happiness to quit smoking?

How we feel impacts what we can do. When we feel angry, stressed, or sad, it is difficult to take on a challenging task, like quitting smoking. But when we feel good, we have strength, confidence and energy to tackle hard tasks.

Science has shown that feeling happier:
- Decreases your urge to smoke
- Increases your confidence to quit smoking
- Gives you courage to act upon the fact that smoking is bad for you
- Makes you more creative, so that instead of lighting up, you can choose to do something else in that moment

In this app, we ask you to work on your happiness. Each day, we ask you to complete a Habit-Building Exercise. Completing these exercises gets you in the habit of noticing the good things in your life, and lets you draw strength from them.

Happiness can also help in the moment of craving. Try out the “Happiness Boost Activities” to feel happier within minutes. And, at the end of a day: a happier life is a happier life! That’s why we believe in smiling instead of smoking.

"⚙No repetitive tasks for you, let your Android device handle it!⚙ Total Automation, From Settings to SMS.

Here are only some of the things you could do with Tasker. Its real power is the flexibility to combine contexts and tasks however you wish: https://tasker.joaoapps.com/exampleuses.html

☑ Automations
Make your phone a true smart phone! Why remember to change the volume every day when you leave home when your phone can do it for you?
Automate stuff based on the app you're in, the time of day, your location, your Wi-Fi network, Received SMS or Calls, the currently playing song and many other (130+) states and events!
Check out how easy it is to create an automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6EAbLW5WSk

☑ Actions
350+ actions allow you to truly customize your phone like never before! Send SMS, create notifications, change almost any system setting like Wifi Tether, Dark Mode, Always On Display, change any volume, control Do Not Disturb, open apps, file manipulation, control music playback, get your location... you get the idea. If you can think of it, Tasker can probably do it for you!
Note: root is NOT (I repeat NOT) required for majority of the functions. However, a few of the actions (like the Kill App and Mobile Data action on some devices) require root. This is because of Android security policies that developers cannot work around.

☑ Automatic File Backups
If you set it up to do so, Tasker can automatically backup your files to a specific folder on the device, SD card, USB key or even Google Drive! This is useful if you want to keep your files safe even if you lose your phone.

☑ Download and Install APKs directly
By your request (if you set up a task to do so), Tasker can automatically check a website for updated APKs, receive those APKs from said websites and initiate installation of any files!

☑ Other Triggers
Manually trigger your actions via launcher shortcuts, quick setting tiles, widgets, long-pressing volume buttons, media buttons (like the ones on your BT headsets or headphones), Bixby button, Navigation Bar, Notifications and more!

☑ Join - Remote Tasker
Adding Join (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.join) to the mix will even allow you to trigger tasks from another Android device or PC!

☑ Scenes
Design your own UI and use it to display any info you want or trigger any task!

☑ App Creation
Create your own standalone apps to share or sell with the Tasker App Factory : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory

☑ Developer Friendly
Many 3rd party developers already allow you to perform actions in their apps and listen to their events/states through Tasker!
Check out some of them: https://tasker.joaoapps.com/pluginlist.html
You can also call most of the Web APIs from Tasker with the powerful HTTP Auth and HTTP Request actions! Check out an example Video of HTTP Auth and Request: https://youtu.be/yAt2D1XmgUI.

“I am so glad we decided to use this tracker app!!! The frequent newborn nighttime feedings turned my brain to mush. Keeping track of my little one's feedings helped so much. At 3 months, we decided to upgrade and track his sleep. He started sleeping through the night (8:30pm - 7:30am) within 3 days! Such a game changer!!! I HIGHLY recommend it!” - Georgette M

“This app is absolutely amazing! I started using it when my baby was first born to time pumping sessions. I then started tracking her feedings and now that she is coming up on two months old I've started tracking her sleep. All the features other than sleep are completely free and we will definitely be getting premium now that we are tracking sleep!” - Sara S.

"Note:
The first level of the game is a free trial. However, other levels need to be paid. It is difficult for us to operate a new game and we hope to gain your support. In the introduction part of Google Play, it has mentioned that the game would be charged. Thank you for your support.


'Death Coming' is a non-linear puzzle game where you take on the role of the Reaper. Your objective? Cause deaths and harvest souls while abiding by the Free Will Clause.

"" --- Background Story ---
You Died.
Pure and simple, but death was not the end. You have become an agent of Death: a Reaper. You have the powers of Death, but there are rules in this supernatural afterlife.

The Reaper ends lives, but it cannot control humans directly due to the Free Will Clause. As the Reaper, you must plan and execute your killings by using the environment to your advantage. In the meantime, be wary of Minions of Light, who will try to save humans from their grim fate!

--- Key Features ---
● Isometric ‘God’ Perspective
View your hunting grounds from a top-down perspective. Follow the lives of your targets and those out to stop you.

● Non-linear Design
Start with any character you want, and solve the puzzles in any order you like within the limits of the Death Traps and weather conditions.

● Observe, Plan, Execute
Observe the victims to find out their behavior and idiosyncracies. Trigger death traps at the right moment to kill efficiently. The better you know their routines, the better you can prepare your death traps.

● Reactive AII
Victims will hang around spots they like and will change their actions and behavior when something happens to them, such as seeing someone die.

● A Morbid Sense of Humor
From suburbia to missile factories, there’s always a wacky way to wreak havoc. Don’t be afraid to laugh at someone’s demise. If you do what you love (in this case, harvesting souls), you'll never have to work a day in your life!

"» Organize Your Life!
HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines

» Fully Customisable
Measure and track anything and everything. Follow your own schedule and track your own goals. Get notified whenever you need to do something important.

» Cut Bad Habits From Your Life
Simply start tracking bad habits like nail biting, smoking or drinking too much. Once you see the patterns, it's easier to break them. HabitBull keeps you accountable. Also great for users of NoFap!

» Add Some Positive Habits
Want to go for a nice walk every day? Or maybe give 3 hugs every Saturday and Sunday? Join us on this journey!

» Who is it for?
Whether you want to read some more, stop smoking, start working out or even just track how many hours you wasted on Facebook, this app lets you do it!

» Features
•  Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
•  Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
•  Yes/No or Number goals
•  Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
•  Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)
•  Graphs with success percentage / streak, entered values etc
•  Powerful reminders - multiple times per day, repeating within a time period, sound and vibrate optional
•  Home screen / lock screen widget
•  Multi-device syncing
•  Cloud backup
•  Motivational images
•  Export to CSV
•  Dark theme
•  Google Fit integration

» How it works:
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase

Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.

To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).

HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.

There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.
It is entirely up to you, really. But why not give it a try and have a convenient helper on the go?","1,000,000+ downloads","Mar 5, 2014","Feb 26, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull
"🌟The Understood app: A Behavior Tracker for parents of kids with ADHD🌟

Having big emotions is part of growing up for any child. But for kids with ADHD or dyslexia, they may be more frequent and intense. This can be overwhelming for both the parent and the child.

The Behavior Tracker was developed by psychologists to help parents understand and effectively respond to their child’s big emotions. It’s based on proven approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Log your child’s challenging behaviors to get personalized insights, learn new strategies, and track your child’s progress — all at your own pace and on your own schedule.


📌 Key Features

• Developed by psychologists: Our Behavior Tracker and lessons were developed by psychologists and are grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). They were designed for parents of kids with ADHD, dyslexia, and other learning and thinking differences.

• Behavior Tracker: In just a few clicks, log your child’s challenging behaviors using the Behavior Tracker. You’ll see patterns emerge that’ll give you clues about the root causes and how they may relate to your child’s ADHD or learning difference.

• Tailored insights: The more you log in the Behavior Tracker, the more personalized insights you’ll get. Insights help you identify common situations and share tips to address them — so you can see improvement in your child’s behavior over time.

• Skillbuilding lessons: Learn techniques and practice new skills developed by psychologists. Figure out what your child with ADHD is trying to tell you. Then decide on the best way to respond.

• Gain new perspectives: Feel closer to your child and gain new perspectives on why they act out. It may have a lot to do with their learning or thinking difference, like ADHD or dyslexia.

• Increase confidence: Parenting is chaotic enough. Gain confidence supporting your child with ADHD when they have big emotions or outbursts. Use new skills and strategies, made just for you.

• De-escalation techniques: Emotional regulation skills can help you tame outbursts and meltdowns as they happen. With practice, your responses can prevent some of them from happening in the future.

• Practice new skills: Put your new skills into practice. And continue to log behaviors to see how new strategies are helping improve your child’s behavior, or to get a refresher on skills you’ve learned.

"Hi, welcome to this magnificent 3D magical land – Ahzeriah. With the new 3D graphics and real-time lighting, you will have a better experience of this classic round-based strategy game that has been well-honed for 5 years.

Over the past five years, we've been trying to figure out what makes a strategy game stand out over time. Here are some of the most well-regarded features of Alliance at War, which will be further upgraded in the 3D remake.

(1) Troop Protection
In AAW, if you don’t want to engage in the war, you’re free to switch your defense mode to avoid it at any time. And with that, you don't have to waste your peace shields or worry about being woken up late at night by various notifications, thus making it easier for you to pace your strategy.

(2) Low Battle Losses and Various Recovery Systems
In addition to the larger hospital capacity and lower system battle damage, the game is also designed to reduce battle losses accordingly for different events. At the same time, AAW has a wide variety of large-scale and zero-loss events that will be available on a regular basis, including a Rogue-like exploration feature, Cross-server War, and Crusade against Demons. Moreover, support systems such as Angel of Salvation and Gate of Rebirth are always available to reduce your damage, helping you enjoy the game more.

(3) Diverse Hero Combinations and Skills
Few strategy games put as much emphasis on battle strategy and graphics as AAW. We’re well aware that in a game with a rich combination of heroes and skill strategies, a single battle report will not give players a thorough understanding of the battle system. Therefore, in the 3D remake, we have further improved the battle screen performance to be cooler and more gorgeous, and to facilitate the sharing and discussion among players.
Each hero is unique and plays a crucial role in the game, such as the Sorceress who focuses on explosive attacks, the Dwarf King who is good at control with a dizzy hammer in his left hand and a petrified ax in his right, and the Oracle who turns time backwards to revive soldiers endlessly and defeat the rivals in war of attrition. In addition, there are six ancient guardians, including the Giant Ape, Pegasus, Cerberus, Cursed Spirit, Phoenix, and Fire Dragon. With the right combinations and formations, a wide range of strategic gameplay comes into being.

(4) Regular Cross-server Wars and Various Events
A great variety of highly rewarding and zero-damage events are designed, allowing you to have fun while also gaining extra rewards to help you grow. Included are the rally attack against Boss, Stronghold occupation, and Cross-server events.

(5) Critically Acclaimed Features
Also, there are many well-received special features that have been well-designed and are still being upgraded, examples of which are as follows.

##The Uncharted Glade Adventure: You have the chance to do a Rogue-like exploration once a day, testing the overall strength of your troops and your strategic ability to use items.
##The Stronghold Fighting Day: It is basically a weekly carnival day for alliances, where you can occupy control towers to gain points in ways that help you defeat your opponents and gain control of rare Strongholds.
##Ancient Artifacts: You can get seven powerful ancient artifacts by completing server quests or plundering other players.
## Alliance Fights against Demons: Reinforce and help your allies, and work together to defend against demons' attacks and win massive rewards.
##Team-up Cave Exploration: Team up with your allies to challenge demons in the mysterious caves. Remember, the right strategy will bring you higher ratings and better rewards.

"Health Diary & Report app helps patients take control of their health by tracking and recording their symptoms, pains, and discomforts. Health Diary allows you to easily keep track of your condition progression and pain history.

— SYMPTOM CATEGORIZATION: Symptoms are automatically categorized so you can list them chronologically.
— SELF-DEFINED FILTERS help you to follow your specific topics and issues.
— INTELLIGENT REMINDERS react to what you last wrote in your diary and remind you to write an update.

The app categorizes each entry according to a medical category system and allows you to define your own personal filters, making it easy to search and filter your entries. You can also include photos in your entries, which are categorized and filtered by the app for easy reference.

One of the most significant advantages of Health Diary is that it helps you to better understand the progression of your symptoms and complaints over time, enabling you to describe your medical history in detail when discussing it with your healthcare providers. You can also use the app to record and keep track of your medication usage, helping you to monitor your treatment progress and communicate more effectively with your healthcare team.

Health Diary & Report is strictly private, meaning that no registration or synchronization is required, and there is no content sharing. This ensures the privacy and security of your data. However, it also means that the app cannot be used on multiple devices simultaneously, and the data cannot be synchronized with a server or cloud service. Users are advised to export their data regularly to secure it.

As the app is still in beta phase, the developers welcome feedback and ideas from early users. Overall, Health Diary & Report is an excellent tool for patients who want to take a more active role in their healthcare and better understand their condition progression.","5,000+ downloads","Jun 6, 2025","Jun 6, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.slowpoke.hammy

We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. This app helps US maintain THAT spiritual condition.

Resentment is the number one offender. Now you can get rid of your resentments fast while on the go with the Spot Check Inventory tool that’s mentioned in Step 10 of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions Book to help with our daily ups and downs, especially those where people or new events throw us off balance and tempt us to make mistakes.

Do you do a Nightly Inventory as suggested in Step 11 of the Big Book before retiring each night? You should and now It’s EASY! With MST just answer 10 simple questions straight from the Big Book and you’re done!

* Read the AA Daily Reflections Fast! Quickly get your daily reflection for the day direct from the Alcoholics Anonymous website.

* We are only as sick as our secrets and the alcoholics anonymous recovery program is all about sharing with others, particularly our sponsors. So My Spiritual Toolkit has a super feature for sharing your inventories, journal and gratitude lists with your sponsor or trusted adviser. Simply Text or Email your sponsor right from within the app and get feedback fast!

* The spot check inventory tool is similar to a mini step 4 inventory. You can create different inventories based on the big book style - resentment, fear, sex and harms done.

* This 12 Step App has a sobriety calculator which keeps track of the number of days you are sober for. Just set your sobriety date on the counter and it will automatically calculate how many days you’ve been sober, years sober, months sober, even hours! Even more fun, you can share this with your sponsor or other trusted advisers from right within the App!

* You also have an Online Journal you can use to clear your head of unwanted racing thoughts and irrational fears before you fall asleep at night. Get those crazy thoughts out of your head and into your journal! Plus you will be able to read old journal entries to see how far you've come.

* Gratitude List - Your recovery program is not complete without the gratitude list tool. This pro tool will take your sobriety to the next level.

* PIN locking will keep your info safe and secure for your eyes only.

* Do you prefer to type on a computer? You can use the accompanying My Spiritual Toolkit Web app from any browser for free! No other app offers this feature!

Prayers included:
- Serenity Prayer
- Big Book Third Step Prayer and Seventh Step Prayer

The Spot Check Inventory (think mini 4th step) allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is encrypted and securely synced to the web app!

Just because you’re a recovering alcoholic doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Oftentimes moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you’re using journaling as part of your recovery from alcoholism, then you don’t have time to sit down and write your feelings out.

- To protect anonymity, the app icon does not show AA references.

"Get Home Safe is a free safety app packed with lots of awesome features.

Simply use the app to share what you're doing, along with your GPS location and set yourself some safety timers.

The app will remind you to check-in or send a fail-safe alert if whatever you are doing doesn't go as planned!

Alerts include GPS tracking, remaining battery, intended destination and a whole lot more and the clever part is the alerts are sent even if your phone is not working!

Be it walking home after dark, cycling, hiking, or even working remotely, we all take the time to tell someone what we are doing.

Next time be smart about what you are doing and use GetHomeSafe to tell others what you are doing or where you are going.

It is simple and quick and so much smarter than texting or leaving a note to say what you are doing.

The GetHomeSafe tracking maps gives the people you choose something meaningful to follow or check while you are out and about and the GetHomeSafe timers will remind both you and your contacts what time you were suppose to check in safely.

Use the Favorites feature to save the details of things you do often for a quick start, just a few clicks and in under five seconds you have told someone you trust what you are doing!! Perfect for things you do often like walking home from school, running or driving.

If you are a supervisor or manager responsible for lots of staff the automation of GetHomeSafe cuts the hard work (and cost) out of checking they are OK while working alone or on a journey somewhere.

For use in any activity where you, your family, your friends or even your boss would like some added reassurance of your personal safety.

"Do you track your goals in your todo app, journal, or custom spreadsheets?

We've been searching for a well-designed goal tracker for years. The leading apps are either uninspirational or hard to use. So we decided to build one that's beautiful and functional.

Higher Goals lets you keep a dashboard of your habits and goals, so you can update them anytime, anywhere. Most importantly, you can customize colors and images to make it your own, a space for your most important ideas.

Here are the goals you can track in the app:

Improve physical and mental health
Remind yourself to drink water every day, exercise twice a week, and meditate morning, etc using the habit tracker.

Take care of your family
Remember to spend quality time with family once a week, tidy up your room once a week, and compliment your spouse every day.

Invest in yourself
Read 12 books a year, finish online courses about AI, coding, writing, design, marketing, or finance using the goal tracker.

Advance your career
Track OKRs or KPIs at work using the goal tracker and grow leadership skills utilizing the mindset tracker.

Build wealth
Set a saving goal, plan steps to launch a side-hustle that generates passive-income, and track revenue goals. Shift to an abundance mindset using the mindset tracker.

Tips for designing habits

If you want to build a new habit, you have to make it dead-simple to do, ideally under 2 minutes. Forming a new habit in 21 days never worked for us because we've made it too challenging. Nothing kills our motivation faster than failing to finish a task 10 times in a row.

On the other hand, small wins help stabilize our new habits, and we can gradually increase the intensity. Listen to the science of Tiny Habits, and you'll see amazing results. Ignore science, and we go back to blame our lack of willpower.

Tips for setting goals

Achievable goals must be Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound. ""Be healthy"" alone is more of a statement than a goal. An achievable goal could be ""Live a healthy lifestyle by the end of the year"" with steps: 1. Choose a healthier diet. 2. Exercise twice a week. 3. Sleep before 11 pm. 4. Floss and shower every day.

Tips for staying motivated and less stressed

The problem with to-do apps today is they are training us to focus on an endless list of tasks instead of our long term vision. This infinite list causes our stress. There is not enough time.

To set yourself free, acknowledge your time is limited and focus your North Star. Higher Goals helps you identify your North Star and then displays it prominently to unlock your intrinsic motivation.

Features

• Daily, weekly, and monthly repeated habits
• Streak stats and weekly completion trends
• Track SMART goals with percentage visualization
• Capture photos when you check off habits
• Shift mindsets and align your goals with your North Star
• Customizable header images and colors
• Sync between multiple devices
• Works offline
• Dark mode

Influences

These books heavily influenced us, and we're continuing to improve the app by integrating more powerful habit-forming techniques.

• ""Tiny Habits""
• ""Atomic Habits""
• ""The Miracle Mornings""
• ""The One Thing""
• ""The Power of Habit""
• ""Mindset""
• ""Nudge""
• ""How will you measure your life?""

Pricing info

Higher Goals is free to use. We offer an optional Pro membership to support the development.

If you want to have more colors to choose from, track more than 20 goals and more than 8 habits, and utilize advanced habit-forming strategies, Pro membership is for you.

"Developed initially for several federal agencies, turns your phone into a detector of ionizing radiation. The GammaPix technology has been successfully tested at independent labs with calibrated sources. It was developed with support from the U.S. Department of Defense, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (U.S. Department of Homeland Security), and the Transportation Research Board (U.S. National Academy of Sciences). We were encouraged by them to bring this technology to the public.

Worried about accidental exposure to radioactive material or acts of terrorism? The GammaPix App can provide timely warning of the presence of radioactivity using nothing more than your phone's camera. While it is NOT meant to be a substitute for dedicated ionizing radiation detectors, it is a rapid and convenient way of making preliminary threat estimates.

We hope you enjoy using GammaPix!

Notes:
• Various circumstances may compromise the measurement or make the results inaccurate.

• Automatic monitoring will use ~1-5% of your battery, but could warn you of radiation even when not using the App.

• A 5 to 10-minute initialization is required before you use the application for the first time. We know this step slows you down, but it really is necessary to get the best results. Please perform this step in a place you know is likely to be free of excessive radioactivity, with your device cool and unplugged.

• For best results make sure no light is getting into the camera when you run the GammaPix App. Putting the phone in your pocket or covering it with a book works well.

• A reading takes about 3 to 5 minutes if there's no danger. Dangerous levels will be reported sooner.

• Try out Settings > Use long third stage for a more sensitive reading!

• The GammaPix App will not work on some phone models because the camera optimization at low light levels gives ""bright"" pictures.

• Not all phone models have been calibrated. We'll use your readings to provide a calibration for your model. The more you take, the sooner we'll have a calibration.","100,000+ downloads",,"Jun 11, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ImageInsightInc.GammaPixLite

"Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is a serious chronic mental health condition, characterized by the presence of pronounced mood swings.

The medical condition was previously known as manic depression, and it is estimated that around 3% of the world's population over the age of 18 may be affected at some point in their life cycle.

The causes of bipolar disorder are diverse and not completely known, although it is estimated that the predisposition to bipolarity is largely inherited through genetics, and can be triggered throughout life by factors such as stress, pregnancy and the use of illicit drugs.

Typical treatment for Bipolar Disorder includes medications prescribed by a psychiatrist, psychological therapies, counseling, and education for family and friends.

Although there is no cure for the condition, with proper treatment it can be brought under control and affected individuals are usually able to work, have families and participate in all aspects of community life.

Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder is not an easy task, since it can be confused or present together with other psychological conditions of different course and severity, which makes it essential to go to a mental health professional to obtain a reliable diagnosis and beyond any doubt.


The TABS Bipolar Scale

The Triaxial Bipolar Spectrum Scale (TABS) was developed by Dr. Greg Mulhauser as a tool to help raise awareness of experiences that might be indicative of bipolar disorder in people over the age of 18.

It differs from other bipolar screening tools that can be found on the Internet by explicitly checking for factors that exclude a possible diagnosis, therefore its results may differ radically from those offered by older online tests.

At Psicopedia we have adapted the TABS Scale with the intention of providing a tool for exclusively personal and educational use, which in no case can replace the assessment carried out by a qualified professional in an appropriate clinical context.

It is important to clarify that the results of this test have not been compared with other structured tools (such as the SCID, for example) for the evaluation of validity in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Therefore, this instrument should not be used to make a diagnosis, but only as a tool aimed at recognizing personal experiences that could suggest a bipolar spectrum disorder.","1,000+ downloads",,"Aug 24, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psicopedia.bipolar

"If you are looking for an excellent GPS tracker, that can work with Open Street Maps or Google, love outdoor activities, or travel - this is the app for you!


Record GPS tracks of your trips, analyze statistics, and share them with your friends!


Geo Tracker can help:
• Making the way back in an unfamiliar area without getting lost;
• Sharing your route with friends;
• Using someone else's route from GPX, KML or KMZ file;
• Marking important or interesting points on your way;
• Locating a point on the map, if you know its coordinates;
• Showing off colorful screenshots of your accomplishments on social networks.


You can view the tracks and the surrounding area in the application using a scheme from OSM or Google, as well as satellite images from Google or Mapbox - this way you will always have the most detailed map of the area anywhere worldwide. The map areas you view are saved to your phone and remain available offline for a while (this works best for OSM maps and Mapbox's satellite images). To record and calculate track statistics only a GPS signal is needed - the Internet is only required to download map images.


While driving, you can turn on the navigation mode, in which the map automatically rotates in the direction of travel, which greatly simplifies navigation.


The application can record tracks while being in the background (on many devices, this requires additional configuration in the system - be careful! The instructions for these settings are available in the application). Power consumption in background mode is greatly optimized - on average, the phone's charge is enough for a whole day of recording. There's also an economy mode - you can turn it on in the app settings.


Geo Tracker calculates the following statistics:
• Distance traveled and recording time;
• Max and average speed on the track;
• Time and average speed in motion;
• Min and max altitude on the track, altitude difference;
• Vertical distance, ascent and speed;
• Min, max, and average slope.


Also, there are detailed charts of speed and elevation data available.


Recorded tracks can be stored as GPX, KML, and KMZ files, so they can be used in other well-known applications like Google Earth or Ozi Explorer. Tracks are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to any servers.


The app does not make money from ads or your personal data. To support the development of the project, a voluntary donation can be made in the application.


Useful tips & tricks to solve common GPS issues with your smartphone:
• If you start the tracking please wait a bit until the GPS signal is found.
• Restart your smartphone and make sure that you have a ""clear view"" of the sky before you start (no disturbing objects like high buildings, forests, etc.).
• The reception conditions are permanently changing because they are influenced by the following factors: weather, season, positioning of satellites, areas with bad GPS coverage, high buildings, forests, etc.).
• Go to phone settings, choose ""Location"" and activate it.
• Go to phone settings, choose ""Date & time"" and activate the following options: ""Automatic date & time"" and ""Automatic time zone"". It may occur that it takes longer until the GPS signal is found if your smartphone is set to the wrong time zone.
• Deactivate the airplane mode in your phone settings.


If none of these tips & tricks helped to solve your issues, deinstall the app and reinstall it again.
Be aware that Google uses in their Google Maps app not only the GPS data but also additional data of the current location from surrounding WLAN networks and/or mobile networks.

"Light Awake uses pulsating light and carefully picked audio to gently rouse you from sleep. Its flashing light is designed to stimulate your circadian system and comfortably move your mind from slumber to consciousness. This is the only wake-up system that is based on the physiology of our eyes and brain.

Currently compatible with iOS devices, this patented technology is especially helpful for:
∙ Shift workers
∙ People with hearing loss
∙ Sleep partners with different schedules
∙ Families with light sleepers or small children
∙ Teenagers and college students
∙ Roommates in close quarters

Light Awake is based on how the brain responds to light. Our body produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, based on how much light it senses. It’s the same biological response that wakes up animals that are active during the day. Birds and dogs don’t need a piercing alarm and neither do humans! Learn more about the science of Light Awake: https://lightawake.biz/

***Note: Light Awake is a different kind of alarm clock***

To ensure proper alarm clock function, after you set your alarm, the screen will dim and go into sleep mode. It is important, if you use another app after you set your alarm, you disable/reset the alarm to ensure the sleep mode is initiated and the alarm goes off properly.","10,000+ downloads",Light Awake USA LLC,"Jul 17, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightawakereimagined

"Health and fitness in daily habits with Ontime Health. Here we take the phrase ‘timing is everything’ and make it a practical, paid-subscription program for health and performance.

Get into your daily routine through check ins related to four areas of health, sleep, fasting, activity and light (e.g. sun and screen time). By developing these daily habits we get into a routine. A routine measuring streaks of fasting, sleep, light health and activity. This creates a lifestyle for top health and performance based on science.

While diet and nutrition have always been a mainstay of health. Now, WHEN we eat is important along with what we eat.

World Class Research
The Ontime app brings the user the simple rules for smart and easy fasting into our life. The fasting or intermittent fasting approach to health has been studied for years in the lab of Satchin Panda, PhD one of the most published and widely cited circadian rhythms and fasting researchers. Small changes are the most sustainable. At Ontime we take our inspiration from the decades of research from Dr Panda. Focused on realistic goals while recognizing everyone has a life to accommodate.

Fasting and meal timing
Fasting has become a common regiment based in part on this research and now we’re introducing simple daily fasting routines customized to fit goals and interests

Sleep and recovery
Adding in the power of sleep. Sleep is a critical part of the day leading to further performance benefits. We know that after a good night's sleep its smart to start the day with a fast before our first meal, limiting screen time and workout timing are factors brought together for better sleep performance.

Light and Dark mode - Start each day, but watch your screen time!
Then light and activity as part of the daily routing will complement the fasting to optimize when our body systems are working. We want our body to be able to focus naturally on the daily cycles of recovery, feeding, exercise and rebuilding. Light and dark themes help.

Exercise
Activity and timing of workouts are also key to optimal health. For example, exercise timing for best muscle performance is an exciting part of the new learnings. Body clocks are set to support physical activity in the earlier parts of the day, and this is enhanced even more when you are following an intermittent fasting routine. Exercise in the morning, especially in the sun, will help you to feel more rested and awake

We are excited to close the gap between the top athletes learning, living and playing longer at the top of their game and bringing that same experience to our users.

Performance and Longevity
Increasingly timing is everything in how top performers stay in the game longer. The learnings from this longevity research are included throughout the content where you will find health tips and content on the latest research.

Focus on challenges important to you

Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, live healthier longer, improve your energy the protocols developed from understanding circadian rhythms are here to help. The challenges explored in science include pre-diabetes, diabetes, cancer, liver disease, obesity and heart disease. In collaboration with leading physicians Dr Panda’s lab has conducted research including thousands of data points to help see us shift our health back to peak performance.

These topics have been featured in many great health science discussions over the years. In particular between Satchin Panda and Dr Rhonda Patrick. More recently Dr Panda’s protocol was detailed by Andrew Huberman from the Huberman Lab. We’re delighted to make this app incorporate more detail since the early days when Dr Panda and other's works inspired many fasting apps.

Dr Panda authored The Circadian Diabetes Code and The Circadian Code. These works detail the science that inspired the simplicity and the core habits promoted in this app.","1,000+ downloads","Feb 21, 2022","Apr 29, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.health.ontime

Use night light anti glare to relieve eye strain and protect eyes from bluelight flux that can disrupt circadian rhythm, cause insomnia and restlessness, chronic migraine, sleepless chronic headache, glaucoma and cataract.

🤔 What is blue light?

It's part of a natural light spectrum, which disturbs the circadian rhythm and causes sleeplessness, headache and bad eye health. Unlike red light night shade, screen light bluelight blocks the secretion of melatonin, sleep hormone, and causes restlessness. Retinal neurons are in danger if night filter anti glare is not used after twilight for eye care.

☹️ Harms of Blue Light

• Eye strain, tired eyes and bad eye health
• Higher risk of glaucoma, and cataract
• Phase shifting of the circadian rhythm, restlessness, and suppression of melatonin
• Chronic migraine pain and activation of the trigeminal nerve
• Chronic headache
• Insomnia, sleepless night time and sleeplessness

Eye Pro - Blue Light Filter as your anti glare night screen and warmlight night mode helps you by relieving eye strain and chronic headache during night reading. Its red light night shade is best for eye care against light blue rays from screen light that cause glaucoma, melatonin deficiency, and sleepless night time - insomnia. Cataract often develops slowly, so start your tired eyes care and improve eye health with bluelight filter by using it as a twilight night light as soon as possible!


🎖 Eye Pro - Blue Light Filter includes:

🌈 Provide 8 blue light filters - Use one of 8 blue light filters to activate night mode and warmlight for eye care against natural light blue rays. Relieve eye strain, macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataract with night filter during sleepless night reading.

"Eyes feel tired during night reading on the phone?

Have trouble in sleeping after long time watching phone screen?

That is due to blue light. Blue light from your phone and tablet screen is the visible light spectrum (380-550nm) for circadian regulation. According to the scientific studies, exposure to blue light imposes serious threats to retinal neurons and inhibits the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. It is proven that reducing blue light can greatly improve sleep.

Features:
● Reduce blue light
● Adjustable filter intensity
● Save power
● Very easy to use
● Built-in screen dimmer
● Eye protector from screen light

"🌟 OPTIMIZE YOUR NATURAL CYCLES & BIORHYTHMS TO RISE, SLEEP, THINK, AND EAT AT IDEAL TIMES
Do you ever feel out of sync with your natural cycles? Circadian is the leading circadian rhythm app. By tuning into your circadian rhythm and honoring your biorhythms, you enjoy better sleep, balanced hormones, and a healthier lifestyle.

☀️ ALIGN WITH SUNLIGHT & SEASONS
Why dissect every sleep cycle or follow a fixed sleep calendar when natural cycles guide you best? This circadian rhythm app harnesses diurnal patterns—risen dawn, UVA/UVB rise & set, solar noon, sunset, and darkness—to set consistent rise & sleep reminders and wind-down alerts. Trust your internal clock to help you establish a smooth sleep rhythm and a natural circadian sleep pattern.

🛏️ BEDTIME CALCULATOR & BIORHYTHM CALCULATOR
Plan your optimal hours of sleep and fasting windows with our seasonal bedtime calculator and robust biorhythm calculator.

Studies confirm syncing with natural cycles outperforms any sleep cycle tracker. Let the natural cycles guide you to entrain your biorhythm with optimal reminders for better sleep, meal, work & exercise times.

🍴 EAT & FAST IN SYNC WITH NATURE
Intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating work best when aligned to daylight. Front-load calories at sunrise and close your eating window by dusk to match your circadian rhythm. Research shows skipping breakfast or dining late disrupts this rhythm and harms metabolic health. With Circadian, set eating & fasting reminders that honor this timing for balanced blood sugar and deeper sleep.

🧬 THE SCIENCE OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS
Built on Nobel Prize–winning chronobiology, this circadian app explains how your internal clock and biorhythms regulate melatonin, cortisol, and vitamin D production. Getting the right circadian cues—light/darkness, food & exercise—at the right time is non-negotiable for a healthy body, mind, and heart. Use Circadian and its extensive learn & research section for tons of actionable insights on your sleep rhythm, artificial light, exercise timing, diurnal living and much more to transform your natural life.

JET LAG MYTHS VS. CIRCADIAN SCIENCE

Misleading advice on conquering jet lag — often promoted by non-experts — not only fails to help travelers but can make jet lag symptoms worse and may even cause harm.

It’s time to replace the myths with real science.

Generic sleep advice, exercise, hydration, grounding, dietary supplements, special diets, or fasting won’t solve jet lag because they don’t ""reset"" your circadian clock to new time zones.

THE REAL SCIENCE BEHIND REDUCING JET LAG

// In your brain, a circadian clock helps manage the regular rhythm of your day.
// Jet lag is caused when your sleep/wake and light/dark cycles shift too quickly for your circadian clock to keep up.
// Light is the key time cue to “reset” your circadian clock, so the correct timing of light exposure and avoidance is the only way to adjust to new time zones quickly. If your timing is wrong, it will make your jet lag worse.

WHY WE MADE TIMESHIFTER

Getting the timing right is both complex and unintuitive. We created Timeshifter to make circadian science accessible and help you apply it to conquer jet lag.

Timeshifter helps you tackle both the underlying cause of jet lag – the disruption of your circadian clock – as well as reduce the disruptive symptoms, such as insomnia, sleepiness and digestive discomfort.

KEY FEATURES

// Circadian Time™: Advice is based on your body’s clock
// Practicality Filter™: Adjusts advice to the ""real world""
// Quick Turnaround®: Automatically detects short trips
// Pre-travel advice: Start adjusting before departure
// Push notifications: View advice without opening the app

PROVEN RESULTS

Based on ~130,000 post-flight surveys:
// 96.4% of users who followed Timeshifter's advice 80% or more did not struggle with severe or very severe jet lag.
// Travelers who did not follow the advice experienced a 6.2x increase in severe or very severe jet lag, and a 14.1x increase in very severe jet lag!

"Solar Circadian Clock, is an app that helps you to resync your body and mind, to it's natural rhythm.

From an evolutionary point, our natural rhythm, is around the day/night cycle, which is determined by the solar cycle.
We didn't use clocks to tell time, and we didn't have lights at night.
Everything we did, was focussed around the sun, including our sleep & wake cycle, hormones and metabolism.

This app uses your GPS Position, to calculate the Solar Times, and the circadian rhythm of your body for each day.

Sunlight & Daylight
The app shows you the progress of the Sun, through the Solar Day, also highlighting the Meal & Sleep Timings.
It includes data on the Sunlight & Daylight Duration, with an active counter.
It also compares the length to the day before and day after, which shows if the Solar Days are getting longer or shorter.

Solar Timings
The app shows the following Solar Times for your GPS Position:
1) Solar Midnight (Start of Day)
2) Twilight Start
3) Sunrise
4) Solar Noon
5) Sunset
6) Twilight End
7) Solar Midnight (End of Day)

Circadian Timings
The app shows the following Circadian Times for your GPS Position:
1) Rise in Blood Pressure
2) Melatonin Secretion Stops
3) Bowel Movement Likely
4) Highest Testosterone Secretion
5) High Alertness
6) Best Coordination
7) Fastest Reaction Time
8) Greatest Cardiovascular & Muscle Strength
9) Highest Blood Pressure
10) Highest Body Temperature
11) Melatonin Secretion Starts
12) Bowel Movement Suppressed

Meal Timings
The app shows you the following meal times, based on your Circadian Rhythm and Natural Metabolism:
1) Breakfast
2) Lunch
3) Dinner

Sleep Timings
The app shows you the following Sleep Times, based on your Circadian Rhythm and Sleep Cycles:
1) Optimal Time to Wake Up
2) Optimal Time to Sleep
3) ""NREM 1"" Stage
4) ""NREM 2"" Stage
5) ""NREM 3"" Stage
6) ""REM"" Stage

The use of Sleep Cycles, allow you to plan your ideal sleep timings to maximise your rest.
Each Sleep Cycle, is further divided to show you the following timings:
Healthy Wake Timings - These are the best times to wake up, with or without an alarm clock.
Natural Wake Timings - These are the times you will be going through REM stage, and should only wake up naturally, without an alarm clock.
Studies have shown that forcing yourself to wake up during these timings, can lead to a negative mood for the day.
Unhealthy Wake Timings - These are the times when you are in your Deepest Sleep.
Waking up during these times, causes ""Sleep Inertia"", which causes you to have slower thinking and reaction.

Solar/Circadian Event Information
For every Solar & Circadian event, you get the following:
Custom Event - Where you can create your own linked event. For Example, you can add ""Go to Gym"", 30 Minutes before the Highest Testosterone event.
Notification - Where you can choose to be notified when it's time for the event.
Favourite - Where you can make the event to be shown more obviously.
Multi-Day Timing - Where you can see the event time for the day before, and next few days, to know if it's getting earlier or later.
You can add them to your device alarm clock or calendar.

Home Screen Widget
You can add a widget to your device's home screen, which will show a list of all the upcoming Solar & Circadian events.

Other Dates
You can also search for the Solar & Circadian Information, for your GPS Location, but for another date.
This is ideal when you are planning for a future event. For example, if you are organising a ""Sunrise Yoga"" event for the weekend.

Other Cities
You can also search for the Solar & Circadian Information, for other cities.
While this lacks the accuracy of using your GPS, it is ideal if you are planning a trip, and wish to plan an event.","1,000+ downloads","Oct 19, 2022","Apr 4, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projectdevante.app.solarcircadianclock

"R.care is the #1 evidence-based program designed to help you stop binge eating and overeating.

- Do you feel out of control around food?
- Do you use food to cope but feel worse afterward?
- Do you feel trapped in a vicious cycle of rigid diets and intense binges?

R.care is not just another glorified calorie counting app or diet program; it's your personalized guide based on the proven principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). This science-backed program is crafted in collaboration with psychiatrists, therapists, and registered dietitians.

Contrary to common belief, what it takes to recover from binge eating is not just willpower or a mere ""just do it"" mentality. Key to stopping binge eating is understanding the root causes (hint: often it’s not just about the food) and applying concrete evidence-based techniques customized to your needs.

With real-time meal coaching, stress-free food and mood logs, a daily structured education program, and many other activities proven to be clinically effective in reducing binges, R.Care guides you to food freedom from the comfort of your own home.

Try R.care, if you are struggling with :

- Recurring episodes of binge eating
- Feelings of guilt or shame associated with eating behaviors
- Difficulty controlling the urge to eat
- Repetitive or obsessive behaviors concerning food, such as hoarding or hiding it
- Avoidance of social activities, especially those involving food.
- Dependence on food or food addiction
- Fluctuations in weight, potentially weight cycling or yo-yo dieting patterns
- Frequent attempts at diets without long-term success in weight management due to restrict-binge cycles.

After the program, you will be able to:

- Start enjoying your favorite food without feeling out of control.
- Say yes to social events without fears of overeating and binge eating.
- Stop spending so much of life and energy obsessing over food.

Overcoming binge eating can be challenging, but that doesn’t mean accessing support should be. If you’re tired of the day-to-day stress and struggles of managing binge eating, we’re here for you. Questions or feedback? hello@recoverycare.app

"Bertie is your evidence-based toolkit that supports recovery from binge eating. With Bertie, you can take control to break the binge cycle and find food freedom.

HOW BERTIE WORKS
Because everyone’s recovery journey is different, Bertie integrates features from different psychological approaches including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness, Self-compassion, and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) to provide you with a complete toolbox for recovery.

Bertie helps you overcome binge eating in 5 key ways:

1. Monitoring & Identifying patterns
Monitoring your meals/snacks provides you with important information about your eating habits and can help you identify patterns in your binge eating. Unlike monitoring you may have done in the past, you are not encouraged to count calories or limit your intake. This is about gathering information about your eating patterns in a non-judgemental way to enable you to make changes. By systematically monitoring your eating, you can gain awareness about particular patterns and triggers. Ther Bertie app provides customisable reminders to log each of your meals and snacks. The charts enable you to clearly visualise your emotional and binging patterns over time.

2. Restoring regular eating
Restoring a pattern of regular eating is the most effective approach to overcome binge eating. In accordance with CBT (the frontline treatment for binge eating), It is recommended that you eat 3 meals and 3 snacks each day. The exact time of your meals and snacks can be customised to suit your schedule (in the app settings), however try not to leave long gaps (e.g., >4 hours) between meals/snacks, as this can create psychological and physiological pressure to eat, which can result in a binge.

3. Building your mindfulness muscle
Binge-eating often involves being disconnected from one’s body and being on auto-pilot. You may find you feel like you are out of control, and have difficulty describing how you feel prior to a binge. Practicing mindfulness can help you improve your eating behaviour by increasing awareness of your bodily sensations, emotions, and thoughts. This in turn can support you to respond more consciously and compassionately to situations, such as your common triggers or difficult emotions. The Bertie app has a unique meditation program tailored to support your recovery journey.

4. Effectively managing strong urges to binge
On the path to recovery, you will likely experience urges to binge. While urges can feel overwhelming and irresistible, it’s important to know that all urges will rise to a peak and then gradually decrease in intensity. The Bertie app uses a unique SOS support tool, to help you manage intense urges. In these critical moments, Bertie guide you step-by-step to get out of auto-pilot, calm your nervous system, and respond with intention.

5. Promoting social connection and community
It might feel like you are the only person struggling with binge eating, but the reality is there are millions of people going through similar experiences. We know that social support and community are two of the most important factors when recovering from binge eating, so Bertie provides an opportunity for both via our moderated social networking forum. Find your people, share information, and get support from others who’ve been through the same thing.",100+ downloads,bertie app,"Jun 23, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bertie.app

"Kubios HRV app uses scientifically validated heart rate variability (HRV) algorithms (used by scientists all over the world) to provide reliable information about your wellbeing and daily readiness. To make HRV measurements with the app, you need a Bluetooth heart rate (HR) sensor, such as Polar H10. Kubios HRV app has two modes of operation:

1) Readiness Measurement Mode monitors changes in your daily readiness status. By doing short (1-5 min), controlled resting HRV measurements regularly, you will receive reliable information about your physiological recovery and/or stress, how it changes from day to day, and how your HRV values compare with normal population values. Readiness monitoring is used by professional athletes in training optimization but can also be used by sports enthusiasts or anyone interested in their wellbeing, as it provides objective information about overall bodily stress as well as cardiovascular health.

2) Custom Measurement Mode, designed for researchers, health and wellbeing professionals, and sport scientists, conducts various types of HRV recordings. This measurement mode supports test-subject management, short- and longer-term measurements, live data acquisition, as well as event markers. Since the app is built with Polar mobile SDK, it can read live data from Polar sensors, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart beat interval (RR) data from Polar H10 sensors and live photoplethysmogram (PPG) and inter-pulse interval (PPI) data from optical Polar OH1 and Verity Sense sensors. Thus, when used together with these Polar sensors, the custom measurement mode will provide an easy-to-use, light-weight, affordable way to obtain ECG, PPG and RR/PPI recordings. Regarding RR recording, the app also supports other Bluetooth HR sensors available on the market. Kubios HRV software license, which supports this measurement mode is required to store measurement data.

HRV is a reliable measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS). It tracks the beat-to-beat changes in RR interval arising from the continuous regulation of heart rate by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS. Kubios HRV analysis algorithms have achieved gold-standard status in scientific research, and our software products are used at roughly 1200 universities in 128 countries. The main HRV parameters include the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) indexes, the computations of which have been optimized, using a large reservoir of scientific research results, to provide accurate interpretation of recovery and stress.","10,000+ downloads",,"Dec 10, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kubioshrvapp
"Find your way into this mystical adventure that is offered by our unicorn game which provides multiple experiences in different areas. You have an amazing chance to play a fruity game that is very similar to the well-known game where you have to match same colors or shapes in order to gain a score and extra points. The game is placed on levels and the more you advance you will see that the challenges begin to increase their difficulty. Along the way, you will see that you can use certain bonuses gained on the caring process. Clean the stable and make a proper environment for your unicorn and you will be rewarded with a very useful bonus on the minigame part. Also when you clean his fur you will get that too. For the hoof bonus, you will have to actually replace his hooves and make sure the unicorn has a suitable treatment while you are doing it. Clean the skin underneath the hood and take care of the part from the top too. One cool thing is that you are able to choose the design for your unicorn aspect. The color fo the mane, the ponytail hairstyle, the corn color and type and other changes might transform your stallion into a beautiful magic unique unicorn. Use your imagination and get that desired look. The levels will upgrade once you pass them and in order to do that you must accomplish the given requirements. Find the asked candies, get the cakes to feed the unicorn and do it with the allowed moves. If you can finish the request with the given moves you will have to play it again until you succeed. Use the bonuses won on the caring part and do your best to fulfill each level.

"""Contribute to a world-wide citizen science project."" (The Guardian)
""Find out exactly how bad the light pollution is."" (Chandra Clarke, citizensciencecenter.com)
""The app couldn't be easier to use, and you can even learn different constellations along the way."" (Nicholas Fordes, plos.org)

The Loss of the Night app turns your eyes into a light meter, allowing you to become a citizen scientist and report how bright the night sky is where you live!

In many parts of the world, the night sky shines with wasted artificial light from poorly designed street lamps. Skyglow outshines the stars in the skies, and dramatically changes the natural nighttime environment. Scientists are concerned that light pollution might have a big impact on nocturnal ecosystems, but they have very little information about how bright the actually sky is worldwide, or how skyglow is changing over the years.

You can help monitor skyglow using this app! It's based on Google's Sky Map, and lets you make measurements with a very sensitive, stable, and well understood light meter: your eyes! All you need to do is look for certain stars in the sky, and tell us whether you can see them or not. Using the Loss of the Night app is both fun and educational, and it also generates important scientific information that might help to protect the environment in the future.

After you've finished your measurement, your data will be anonymously sent to the GLOBE at Night project. You can see it on a map, check how accurate your measurment was, track changes over time, and compare it to other observations from around the world at http://www.myskyatnight.com.

Counting stars is a great experience and family activity, and you might find that you learn the names of stars and constellations without even trying. Students can use the app to measure skyglow and star visibility for their own science projects, and at the same time be part of a global citizen science network. The most important information for this project comes from brightly lit places where you can't see many stars, but you're welcome to use it in places where you can still see the Milky Way. If you’re lucky enough to be in such a place, let others know!

Satellites look at the ground, not the sky. By comparing the skyglow to the ground brightness, you will help communities learn what types of lamps light the streets instead of the sky. Hopefully in the future, cities will save energy and money, while having appropriately lit streets, dark bedrooms, and a sky once again full of stars.

Lots more information, including details of preliminary results, is available on the project blog: http://lossofthenight.blogspot.com and the campaign website of seeing stars Leiden: https://seeingstarsleiden.pocket.science/

You are welcome to get into contact with the light pollution researchers from Verlust der Nacht that built this app, and learn about their other projects (https://www.verlustdernacht.de). The app also provides some basic information on the history, importance, and consequences of artificial light at night.

"‘To hit a target of worth takes practice and courage. Believe you can do it, keep trying and you will get there.’

Worth Warrior is a free app created for young people to manage negative body image, low self-worth, and related early-stage eating difficulties or disorders. Created for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Dr Krause, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, in collaboration with young people, the app uses principles from the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E).

Like all stem4's award winning apps, it is free, private, anonymous, and safe.

The app provides a range of helpful activities and information, based on the notion that through learning to challenge and change thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and body image issues underlying low self-worth, eating and body related issues can be helped.

By identifying these underlying factors, and monitoring them over time, you can also start to identify what your triggers and maintaining factors are and work towards making positive change.

The ‘Change the Story’ section of the app helps identify negative self thought and learn how to substitute positive self-thoughts. ‘Change the Action’ focuses on identifying negative behaviours and altering them. In ‘Change the Emotion’ users are provided with alternative, self soothing behaviours to manipulate their eating and in ‘Change the way I view my Body’ users are taught how to separate fact from assumption.

There is also a range of information within the app for users to learn more about eating disorders, such as the importance of regular eating and hunger, the health consequences of eating-related behaviours, and issues that maintain eating disorders.

The app also allows users to build a ‘safety net’ of helpful thoughts, behaviours and people to contact, and signposts to help. Finally, users can monitor and keep track of which app activities help, record thoughts and feelings in a journal, and view daily motivators.

We understand the importance of privacy and so no identifiable data is collected in the app and no WIFI access or data is required.

It is built to NHS standards.

Please note that the Worth Warrior app is an aid in treatment but does not replace it.

Worth Warrior is the latest app in stem4’s digital portfolio of apps that use evidence-based principles to help young people manage the symptoms of mental health difficulties and disorders. As of June 2022, stem4’s existing apps (Calm Harm, Clear Fear, Combined Minds and Move Mood) have been downloaded over 3.25 million times, and have received various awards including:

- The Digital Leaders 100 Awards ‘Tech for Good Initiative of the Year’ in 2020, for stem4’s full app portfolio

- The Health Tech Awards Winner ‘Best Healthcare App of the Year’ in 2021, for Calm Harm

"Does anxiety make socialising difficult for you?

Does self consciousness sometimes stop you forming deep connections with people?

Social anxiety or social phobia can be crippling. When so much of life depends on being able to interact freely with others, social anxiety can block your development in many different areas.

We know that introverts suffer most from social anxiety, but it's rarely discussed why this would be when, in fact, it's quite simple. In social situations, most of the time you want your attention to be focused outwards, onto other people. Introverts tend to have powerful imaginations, which can grab the attention and focus it inwards. Feelings of anxiety then turn the imagination in an unhelpful direction.

The trick is to lower anxiety so that the ebb and flow of attention can be managed more artfully, in which case the imagination can be a wonderful aid to socialising. The reason hypnosis can be so effective for social anxiety is that, more than anything else, hypnosis is the artful management of the attention.

The free hypnosis session in the Social Anxiety Hypnotherapy app from Uncommon Knowledge will firstly, relax you wonderfully deeply. Then it will work with your unconscious mind to change your response to social situations.

During the hypnosis sessions in the app, your attention will be guided to experiences that are enjoyable and beneficial, in preparation for real life social experiences. Then, when a real life social situation occurs, your mind and emotions will be ready and 'trained' in how to respond with relaxation, playfulness and outwardly focused attention.

With over 20 years experience, and more than 750,000 hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to get your unconscious mind on your side.

The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session. You can use that for as long as you like, but if you want more variety at any time you can upgrade to the monthly paid option and access 10 more social anxiety sessions.

On of our popular sessions 'Overcome Self Consciousness' is free inside the app to get you started right away. Then, if you like what you hear, you can unlock the other sessions with the monthly payment option.

From Uncommon Knowledge, delivering hypnosis since 1998.

"Body Measurement & BMI Tracker has helped over 500,000 users achieve their weight and body fat goals.

The app allows you to track and chart all of your most important body measurements including weight, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, body fat percentage, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Don't keep your weight - Lose it!

In addition to being a weight loss tracker, this app allows you to track any custom body measurements you can think of (shoulders, skeletal muscle %, body water %, etc) on your mobile device. What’s more, you can instantly chart the changes in your body stats over time, and your data is automatically synced to the cloud if you log in.

⭐SIMPLE CALCULATIONS - CALORIE & BMI CALCULATOR⭐

The app also includes a built-in body fat calculator and will calculate lean body mass, body fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI & daily caloric needs as well.

The app will also import nutritional information allowing you to see Calories Consumed, Calories Expended and Net Calories plotted against any measurement or calculated value. This integration requires an in-app purchase.

⭐BODY FAT PERCENTAGE⭐

When using a weight loss tracker, it is important to monitor not only what and how much you eat, but also your weight and other indicators of health such as body fat percentage, waist, hips, BMI, etc.

Since body weight can fluctuate up to 5 lbs (2.3kg) per day, it is important to weigh yourself on a regular basis and at a consistent time every day. This way, by looking at your body measurement chart, you will be able to assess your weight loss trend over time.

Some digital scales provide an estimate of body fat percentage, which you can save within Body Measurement Tracker to determine whether your weight loss is a result of a desirable loss in body fat. Alternatively, by measuring waist, neck, height, and hip circumferences the app’s body fat calculator will automatically calculate body fat and lean mass percentages and chart them over time.

If your lean body mass is calculated successfully, the app will also estimate your daily caloric need based on your stated activity level and sex.

⭐MONITOR YOUR WEIGHT AND MEASURES⭐

Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker is customizable allowing you to track anybody measurement you can think of and ignore the ones you are not interested in.

The following measurements are included by default:
📌 Waist
📌 Weight
📌 Hips
📌 Body Fat Percentage
📌 Body Mass Index (BMI)
📌 Chest
📌 Upper Arms (biceps and triceps)
📌 Lower Arms (forearms)
📌 Upper Legs (thighs/quads and hamstrings)
📌 Lower Legs (calves)
📌 Height

⭐BODY PROGRESS PHOTOS⭐

Keep tabs on how you look over time by taking an unlimited number of pictures of your body. Just like the rest of your data, your body progress photos are automatically synced so they can be viewed across devices, so you never have to worry about losing them ever again.

⭐CALCULATED BODY STATS⭐

The following body stats are automatically calculated if you have recorded the required measurements:
✔️ Body Mass Index (BMI) - This is the ratio of body mass to the square of the body height and is a very commonly used index to categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and more.
✔️ Body Fat Percentage - This represents the total weight of fat divided by the total body weight. It can be estimated in many ways, but since the body fat calculator relies on the measurement of height, weight & body circumferences, the Navy Method for body fat estimation is used. This method relies on waist, neck & height measurements for males and waist, neck, height, and hip measurements for females.
✔️ Waist to Hips Ratio - The waist to hips ratio is a useful indicator of overall health.

"Hourglass exercises for a curvy body are predominately going to consist of moves that target the obliques, or the transverse abdominals muscles. An hourglass figure typically consists of a smaller waist balanced by a larger bust and curvier hips.

At Home Slimming Exercises For Women
Since it’s hard to spot-reduce fat in just one area of your body, it’s important to focus on overall weight loss if you want to drop inches from your waist. But there are some exercises and workouts that have been proven to be more successful at targeting fat around your midsection. Our workout plans will help you to tone your body with curves in all the right places. The exercises will flatten your stomach, shrink your waist to provide a small waistline, tone your thighs, make your butt rounder and hips wider.

We added leg exercises at home that require no equipment and with instructions videos it's ideal for beginners. If you’re looking for a challenging routine to really smoke your legs and glutes, a lower-body workout with no equipment might not be the first option you think of. But it’s a misconception that you need equipment like barbells, dumbbells, or even resistance bands to really make your muscles work.

The emphasis of what you work on will depend on your natural shape.
If you’re already slim all around, you may want to start by building muscle around your shoulders and chest area to get broader on top. If you carry weight around your midsection, you’ll likely want to prioritize whittling that away.

30-day trim waist challenge: slim and tone in just one month
Designed to twist-and-turn your way to a slimmer, more toned middle. This program will help you sculpt and tone your waist for a slimmer, leaner look. The best workouts for abs incorporate twisting and turning to help burn fat and sculpt your sides for a long and lean torso - which is exactly what this plan is designed to do! Working the obliques helps to sculpt, tone and cinch your belly and tightens the midsection.

Are you dreaming of an hourglass figure?
Most people admire the women in the gym that have itsy-bitsy waists and full, shapely hips. If fuller-looking hips are a preference of yours, our exercises for shapely hips can help. To add some curves to your hips, there are certain muscles that need to be trained regularly. These muscles include your internal and external obliques as well as your abductors and gluteal muscles.

When you isolate a muscle or muscle group consistently, you can strengthen and shape that part of your body. Strengthening your obliques tightens the muscles. Working your hips and glutes will tighten, tone, and lift, to leave you with a more voluptuous hourglass figure.","50,000+ downloads",powerpunch - data driven workout programs,"Nov 10, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.powerpunch.hourglass

Edward Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) - also called Deep Muscle Relaxation (DMR) - is a scientifically recognized relaxation method that helps to get into a state of deep relaxation through muscle tension and relaxation.

Integrative health and nutrition is about understanding the relationship between:

🏋️Your body’s health

It’s not about restricting foods or counting calories to achieve a weight loss goal. With Shape, you are worthy of nourishing yourself well, starting with the food you eat. Add more nutritious foods and drinks to your diet and discover the joy in cooking and eating nutrient-rich recipes.

Go beyond healthy eating: replace judgment with curiosity and exchange comparison for compassion. You do not need to be a certain weight or have a certain body type to deserve self-kindness. You already have a body to treasure.

Eat well, but not to become worthy. Because you are already worthy, choose to eat well.

"HYPNOSIS TREATMENT FOR WEIGHT LOSS

So many people struggle with restrictive and frustrating diets, only to fall back into old habits... This is because sheer willpower is often too weak against deeply ingrained habits in the subconscious. You can't lose weight if you don't address first the emotional, psychological, and behavioral roots of the issue. Hypnosis precisely targets these deep, key levers of success. This technique helps dislodge limiting beliefs, lift any blockages, and remarkably strengthen your ability to take action.
By working on your subconscious, you can slim down much more NATURALLY, easily and sustainably.

This exciting and effective 21-Day Program is designed by experts in hypnosis, neuroscience and nutrition.

FIRST BENEFITS:
- Improve self-esteem / self-confidence
- Remove limiting beliefs
- Activate resilience
- Fix the gut-brain connection
- Heal from emotional eating
- Reduce appetite
- Strengthen motivation
- Decrease cortisol
- Accelerate metabolism
...

HOW IT WORKS?
> Answer a few questions, indicate your goal weight, and get your personalized 21-day program
> Listen to your 15-minute session every night at bedtime and deeply absorb positive suggestions
> Accelerate weight loss thanks to additional Booster sessions

Don’t consciously intend to lose weight right away. Just listen to the sessions comfortably. And if you usually weigh yourself, put the scale aside for now. Break out of usual routines, trust the process, let go, and simply enjoy the experience. Progress will come gradually and surely. While you may notice changes from the first sessions, it's by the end of the 21 days that you’ll have established the deep foundations for slimming down...


SUBSCRIPTION PRICES AND CONDITIONS

Kure offers a 12-month subscription and a 1-month subscription, automatically renewable, which gives you unlimited access to the hypnosis program for as long as your subscription is active.

"When you or someone you love is using drugs or alcohol, it can be hard to get help.

Confidant is something new and different in addiction recovery.

Most addiction recovery clinics focus on 12-step based abstinence-focused sobriety. For many people, that path is outdated and doesn’t fit the lifestyle of those who haven’t hit “rock bottom”.

We know there are millions of people, like us, who want to change the way they’re using drugs and alcohol without having to put their life on hold by going to drug rehab or an intensive outpatient program for the next 30 days to get sober.

So, we teamed up with modern-recovery researchers and patient advocates to dive into the latest scientific evidence and medical knowledge to uncover the best way to make changes to your alcohol or drug use.

What we found was a simpler way - focused on the person, not just the substance. You should not have have to uproot your life, question every choice you’ve ever made, and become an unrecognizable person.

Addiction recovery should be person-centered, straightforward and judgment free. Whether that means Medication-Assisted Treatment like Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. or online therapy we support a variety of paths.

Here’s how Confidant works:

- Download the app
- Start ReVAMP- our behavior change platform
- Speak with providers who can help you in 1:1 therapy
- Book online therapy appointments right in the app
- Meet with healthcare providers on your phone (they can help with Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. if appropriate)

We provide everyone who uses Confidant access to a Matchmaker, who acts as your personal concierge and can answer any questions you may have and get you connected to all these resources.

Not interested in talking with someone about this yet? We get it. Talking about substance use is hard and it takes time to build trust. That’s why we created ReVAMP to guide you.

ReVAMP is our DIY behavior change program. Simply answer questions about your goals, activities and feelings and it will help you identify your core values. Next ReVAMP produces a personalized plan to help you unlock your best self by drinking less, using drugs less or quitting altogether.

At Confidant, we don’t judge. We’re here to help you and that’s it.

Confidant Health is perfect if you want to:

- Drink less
- Quit drinking
- Get sober
- Use drugs less
- Quit drugs
- Connect with a Recovery Coach
- Consider sobriety
- Learn about Substance Use Disorder (SUD), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)
- Get online therapy
- Receive Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
- Receive Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc.
- Join an online addiction recovery support group
- Explore online rehab or virtual addiction recovery services
- Educate yourself on addiction recovery including AA, NA, holistic therapy, evidence-based approaches and beyond.
- Something more than a drink tracker, sobriety tracker or habit tracker
- Online alternative to addiction treatment centers
- Learn about medications for opioid use
- Learn about medications for alcohol use
- Just feel better!

Who will be helping you at Confidant Health?

You may connect with prescribers who can help with Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) using Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine and others.

We also have addiction recovery coaches who can help you better understand your relationship to drugs, alcohol and/or your own journey through their own lived experience.

Confidant Health also has therapists ready to discuss addiction recovery from just using drugs less or drinking less all the way to sobriety. Regardless of your own journey Confidant Health is judgment free and can help you attain your mental health goals.

You can also filter plane data so that you will see only planes that fit a given filter criteria using the various flight parameters and variables available here: http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Documentation/Formats/AircraftList.aspx

Built-in ADSB receiver/Dump1090 server listener functionality so with the correct hardware connected to your mobile device you can receive live plane data in your area directly from the air.

Real time GPS feature which allows users to leverage their GPS receiver on their device to provide real time speed, direction and altitude of their present movements.

Proximity Alert feature depending on distance and height away from aircraft to your current GPS position provides a visual and audible warning ""traffic"".

3D View mode with over 1000 airliners and military planes including the Beluga, Chinook, Harrier and Apache models not to mention many liveries of balloons, gliders, small planes and helicopters.

3D with VR - using an Android device that has the correct sensors (namely gyro, gravity and compass) you will be able to move your phone around in a full 360 degree circle in the real world and see where planes are positioned around you.

You can also connect to tile map servers and add more realism to 3D.

"This application is a companion to the Doctor Panic boardgame.
It will improve the fun you have when playing, thanks to its random track and its integrated events. 

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION

Each game lasts 12 minutes. For optimal use, disable any timed sleep mode/standby timer on your smartphone. 

When a cardiac arrest occurs, after the electro-shocks, make sure that one player presses the ""shock given"" button to validate the given code. It is possible that the patient heartbeat won’t recover at that point. If this is the case, a new code will appear and the electro-shocks will have to be re-applied.

CONTENTS OF THE APPLICATION

- selection of patients to be saved
- 4 stages/levels of the game (initiation, easy, normal, difficult)
- A track containing random cardiac arrests and events
- publication of your results on Facebook (what horror!)

GAME EXPERIENCE

Enter the frenzied atmosphere of a hospital. Stitch, (protip: Suture is also used in the lingo), scan, revive..... Are you capable of saving the patient in less than 12 minutes?

Eight different tests await you, and you have to succeed in all of them with your team-mates. Watch out, the random, unforeseen ""events"" will turn your operation topsy-turvy!

Doctor Panic is a cooperative game for 2 to 9 players.

"Eat slower. Feel fuller. Build habits that help you stay healthy — without counting calories.

Whether you eat too fast, overeat, or just want to be more mindful, this app helps you retrain how you eat using simple, science-backed techniques.

🧠 Why eating slowly matters
Rushing through meals can lead to overeating — before your brain even realizes you're full. But chewing more and eating for at least 15 minutes gives your body time to catch up.

Studies show fast eaters are at higher risk of:
- Obesity (3x)
- Diabetes (2x)
- Fatty liver (23x)
- Hyperlipidemia (1.8x)

🍽️ How this app helps
- Visual cues to slow down and chew more
- Mindful eating timer to stretch meals to 15+ minutes
- Slows you down so your brain can catch up with your body’s fullness signals
- Wear OS support — your smartwatch vibrates to cue swallowing (Great for noisy environments where phone vibration isn’t noticeable)
- Food journaling: record your meals with quick notes and photos during eating — no calorie counting, just mindful reflection on your habits

Build a healthier relationship with food — one bite at a time.

"Embrace exercise with at-home workouts that will change your body. After age 30, we start to lose muscle. After age 40, we lose 3–8% of muscle every decade. That is why we have redefined fitness to meet you where you are with innovative strength training and mobility.

Try our most popular, Weekly Schedule, which provides new workouts each week including strength, barre, cardio and mobility. You choose the length of workouts and how many days a week you need and can fit in – x3, x4, or x5 with walking!

Our fitness programs are for beginners to life-long athletes taking into account our changing bodies as we age. The workouts can be done in as little as 25 minutes, 3 times a week. No experience necessary, just show up and press play. Here’s a break-down where you can start:

GETTING STARTED: If you're new to exercise, get started with our initial two-week program.

WEEKLY SCHEDULE: Weekly workouts where you choose your plan - 3x a week, 4x a week, or 5x a week. These workouts create cardio endurance, build strength, and keep you motivated no matter your fitness level. New workouts are uploaded every week.

SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS: For all stages of life - including prenatal, postnatal and core restore for ab separation. They focus on core stability, pelvic floor, healing diastasis, strength and mobility during pregnancy, postpartum and after.

NUTRITIONAL GUIDANCE: Recipes and meal plans from our registered dietitian following simple nutritional guidelines. We believe in integration not elimination.

MORE WORKOUTS:

Mat Core – A mat core and Pilates workout that emphasizes strengthening deep core muscles and enhancing flexibility and body alignment.

Sculpt – Think traditional strength training utilizing both isolation and compound exercises with dumbbells, sliders and bands for maximum effectiveness.

Cardio – Low and high–impact cardio options with sprints, moderate and recovery intervals. We also encourage walking! In our Weekly Schedule you get to pick your cardio!

Barre – Burn out targeted muscle groups through unique high repetition moves, with added challenges like pulses & isometric holds. This class is unlike any other – squeeze, pulse and sweat without added stress to your joints.

WHO WE ARE: I’m Lindsay! I take my decades of experience and break down Exercise Science while showing you how to experience real change. It is fitness redefined. Fitness with real heart and grace aligning with your goals, schedule, hormones and life’s unpredictability. It’s time to embrace exercise that serves your body well.

Through multiple focus groups and research, I’ve found that traditional strength training combined with my love for Pilates and Barre equals a healthy, happy body that will serve us well. It’s my mission to spread my health and fitness knowledge honed over decades and help women feel good! You don’t have to go to extremes to see extreme results. Balance is the key to real change! Let me show you how.

"Are you looking for a quit smoking tracker to quit cannabis for life? 📛

You need Grounded: Quit Weed - the #1 quit weed app. Dedicated to helping you quit weed or to take a tolerance break, the stop smoking app can help you stay smoke-free or quit your habit completely.

Whether you’re here to quit cold turkey or to take a tolerance break (T-break), we have all the quit cannabis tools you need in your weed smoking cessation journey.

📛STOP USING & TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE✅

Although weed / marijuana is nowhere near as destructive or as addictive as a cigarette (not even close!), and the plant itself has been noted to contain many health benefits and many other uses such as hemp, and CBD, there is a growing number of findings that a percentage of its users can become addicted to it.

THC in marijuana may not be physically addictive, but users can become dependent on it for a number of reasons. Dependence can range from, avoiding life problems, and boredom to dealing with anxiety, and depression. If marijuana has caused a negative impact on your life, Grounded can help you quit smoking, vaping and transform your life. With our stop smoking trackers quitting smoking is easy, focused and mindful which gives better results to stop this health harming bad habit.

✖️OR TAKE A SHORT BREAK

We also recognize that some users who would like to use Grounded are not life long ganja quitters but may just want to take a short break to increase their tolerance, or to flush the THC out of their system. So besides stop smoking trackers, we have provided tools to help them track breaks also. Grounded provides all the quit tracker tools and resources needed for all our 420 friends on all sides of the 420 spectra. With our weed tracker and quit smoking app you are in complete control of how you consume your weed.

👍HOW IT CAN HELP YOU

- Our quit cannabis journal gives you a health stats section that includes a list of withdrawal symptoms and how long until the symptoms will be gone

- The health stats sections of our weed journal also track how long until your tolerance is reset. Your cannabinoid receptors need to be reset for THC to be fully effective

- Use our weed tracker to log your daily feelings in your give up smoking journey. This helps you learn more about your cravings and weed abstinence

- Count how long you’ve stayed away from cannabis. Our precise quit cannabis tracker will calculate even the seconds when you avoid smoking cannabis.

- Unlike most weed journal and bad habbit quitting apps, here you can also watch your money grow because of how much you’ve saved from quitting cannabis.

- Stay motivated and get rewarded with achievements for the amount of time you’ve been able to quit cannabis. This is another important tool if you want to quit for life.

"""EMF Protection"" reduces emf-exposure ⚡ by automatically enabling airplane mode ✈️ whenever you turn off your phone (should've called it ""EMF Reduction"", to be precise 😉). You are able to define an Interval ⏱️, so you'll still receive notifications from time to time!

EMF Protection should work with most devices. If there are any problems, please visit dontkillmyapp.com and follow the described steps to allow the protection to work correctly in the background!

EMF (electromagnetic frequencies) might be harmful ⚠️ to your cells and therefore your body and health. EMF Protection will decrease the exposure drastically whenever you turn off your phone. This includes the most important moments: when your phone is in your pocket.
Normal ANTI-EMF cases, stickers, and other products won't work as efficiently. Often cases will make it more difficult for the phone to connect to data or Wi-Fi, which will increase the frequency ⚡ because the phone tries harder to connect!

"Relay is the top program to quit porn addiction for good.

Regardless of how long you've dealt with this issue, Relay was designed to address the root causes of unwanted behavior so that you can find sobriety, heal inner wounds, and restore deeper intimacy and connection in your relationships.

WHO IT'S FOR
Relay is a comprehensive, 16-week program for anyone seeking recovery from sexual addiction (quitting porn or other compulsive sexual behavior).

We offer private groups for both men and women (separated by gender).

Our program is perfect for those who have tried other options but felt like something was missing. Relay gives you a clear, structured path to help you rewire your brain and actually solve the underlying problems that have kept you stuck — not just put a band-aid on it like internet blockers do (sorry, Covenant Eyes).

WHY RELAY IS UNIQUE
Developed together with licensed therapists who have 40+ years of combined addiction expertise, Relay's program provides interactive video lessons, a private accountability group, and variety of psychology-based tools to help you slow down the addictive cycle and replace it with a healthy system for renewal and fulfilled living.

We start by helping you craft a personalized plan for your unique situation, which we'll review with you in a 15-minute phone call during Week 1.

The more you check-in and record your data, the better able Relay is to surface patterns and help you make intelligent adjustments to be more successful.

The biggest reason people choose Relay is for the tight-knit group format. Within your team, you can stay anonymous to protect your confidentiality while still gaining access to true connection and shame-free accountability. All communication happens via secure group chat in the app, but you can also join live meetings via Zoom if you want to go deeper (hint — most people LOVE the live meetings despite feeling nervous to jump in at first).

In summary, Relay's program is great for people who want a deeper, comprehensive approach that includes therapist-created lessons, group-based accountability, and personalized feedback. It's a human-centric approach to recovery.

TESTIMONIALS

-> ""This program has changed my life in 6 months."" - Matthew

-> ""You cannot put a price tag on this platform. What you get out of it pays for itself."" - Bryan

-> ""Relay has provided a source of constant encouragement and sense of community that no other program I've seen can do!"" - James

PRICING
Our mission is to build a platform that is 10x easier and more effective than anything else out there.

We are a very small team with limited funding, and we're doing our best to stay afloat with the current economy. By charging a reasonable fee, it allows us to support the costs of enlisting a world-class team of psychologists and technical folks needed to continue to expand the program resources. Please check out all of our reviews below if you want to hear from real customers about why Relay has been worth it for them.

To make the investment zero risk, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee: if you don’t find the program helpful to you after 30 days, we'll help you obtain a refund. Additionally, we never want cost to be the barrier for anyone serious about getting help, so we offer limited scholarships to help provide access to people who truly can't afford the cost.

Email support@joinrelay.app if you're in this situation and we'll do our best to help.

"Get over your bad habits and addictions more easily for life. This app allows you to monitor, record and analyze your bad habits to increase your self-control and improve your lifestyle.

How does the habit tracking app work?
It is said that it takes 21 days to form a new habit, so why not give it a try.
To get started, all you need to do is enter the type of habit, the name and the start date. Goals will be met as time increases.

Which habits can be stopped?
There is no limitation, since the icons of addictions are simply indicative and you can write your own addiction, although among the predefined ones there are the following:
Quitting alcohol, drugs, tobacco, junk food, social networks, video games, porn, nofap, gambling, coffee, weed, and a long etcetera.

Relapse counter
If you ever have a relapse, it is very easy to reset the counter. You only have to indicate how much time or money you have lost and it will be deducted from the total.

Habits Widget
If you want to always have a particular habit at hand, you have the possibility to create a widget to view it from the application menu of your phone.

Habit statistics and calendar
We have worked to create an intuitive app, so all the information has been condensed into a single view. The habits calendar shows all the relapses during the month. You can see all the time or money saved through abstaining and savings forecasts from the week to the century.

Types of bad habits and addictions
You can choose 3 types of addictions:
1. Those that make you lose money
2. Those that make you waste time
3. The ones that make you lose energy and vitality

Customization of habits
Unlike other apps, this application allows you to change the color of addictions whenever you want and totally free. There are a total of 12 gradients specially designed to match each other.

Daily notifications
Every time you achieve a new goal or progress in your addiction, you will receive a new push notification congratulating you on your new achievement. The habit goals are the first 24h, 3 days, 10 days and so on until the year, in which the habit is considered to be more than overcome.
Of course, this option is optional and you can disable it at any time.

Affirmation of the day
To boost your confidence and motivation, a daily affirmation is displayed. It has been proven that daily affirmations are able to increase people's confidence, security and perseverance.

Security PIN
If you want to keep your privacy and no one can see what addictions you are trying to quit, the Security PIN is ideal for you.

"Get started today with this proven hypnosis & meditation program and eliminate smoking and vaping forever!

By quitting smoking with this program you can expect your health to start to improve; you’ll have more energy and vitality, increase your life expectancy, have less stress, enjoy younger looking skin, fresh breath and whiter teeth. Plus you’ll have more money and healthier loved ones.

Using hypnosis is the most effective way of stopping smoking for good according to a study by New Scientist (Vol 136 Issue 1845).

Embark on our QUIT program now for a radical change in your behavior and quit smoking once and for all. Because to QUIT smoking you have to cultivate the belief and feeling that you are a non smoker. Hypnosis allows you to get directly to the root of the problem and therefore change your beliefs and feelings about smoking forever.

This easy to follow program will allow you to really see how smoking has been manipulating you. Each audio has been specifically designed to destroy all the facets of your addiction to smoking so that you can enjoy a happier, healthier and smoke free life.

Hypnosis is a powerful tool, but it still can sometimes need complimentary therapy or counseling sessions in conjunction with this. As it highly depends on how much work the user is willing to invest this series does not guarantee complete stopping of smoking for everyone.

"Are you curious to find out how much you use your cell phone compared to other people? AntiSocial is designed to not only help you understand what ‘normal usage’ looks like, but to give you the tools to manage, block and control your cell phone usage so that you can unplug, minimize distractions and focus on the things that matter.
While there are other apps available that are designed to restrict phone usage, AntiSocial feels strongly about empowering the user by giving them the information they need to take necessary action. This is done through the clearest and most simple interface available and is the only app to deliver detailed reports full of all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Knowledge is power, and from there it’s up to you whether you want or need to take action to control your cell phone usage. The app offers the ability to manage, block apps and restrict usage but again, this is entirely up to the user.
AntiSocial empowers you to take control of your phone time and minimize distraction. We understand that controlling cell phone usage may be a bigger problem for some than others which is why on top of delivering information to the user, you can also take action by blocking apps, disabling apps and restricting your usage to give you some much needed off time if you’re feeling addicted. And while it may not be a catastrophic problem yet, it is becoming harder for us to unplug and disconnect from our phones. We understand it can be difficult to avoid the distraction of our cell phones, especially when it comes to studying, working or downtime. The ability to block games and block social media can go a long way to achieving a better mental state and minimizing distraction so you can focus on what’s important.

Free with no ads.

"Determining the molecular structure of organic molecules experimentally can be a tricky challenge! Chemists do this by taking a number of different types measurements, and solving the puzzle a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle. We use techniques such as:

• microanalysis
• mass spectrometry
• infrared spectroscopy
• nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

This app allows you to be a 'chemical detective' and take all of the available clues for different molecules and solve their molecular structure! One by one, each spectrum reveals information about a molecule, such as the size, the functional groups, and the number of each kind of atom, which can then be pieced together.

Mastering Your Naming Skills
Another important skill in chemistry is naming organic molecules. This can be tricky too, but there is clear method follow. This app will teach you how to name molecules too, as once you have solved the structure of your molecule, you will need to enter the name of the structure into the app.

Challenge Your Friends to a Duel!
In Chemical Detectives you can set up a challenge between classmates and friends. Set the timer, and the number of problems, then GO! You can also choose from easy, medium or hard, which toggles between multiple choice and full text-entry, which is the best way to master your naming skills. Maybe even challenge your teachers!

"KnowDrugs is the easiest way to lookup drug testing results, pill warnings and drug alerts and provides you with drug info about more than 200 drugs, along with advice on harm reduction and safer use. Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.

DRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION

Check the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.

KnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.

DRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS

Search for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).

Drug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.

If you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.

HARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE

Harm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.

KnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.

KNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU TO:

- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival
- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.","500,000+ downloads",Plant Product Design,"Mar 26, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.phk.knowdrugs

"🌿 Unconscious Moderation: Change your relationship with alcohol — from the inside out.


Are you ready to drink less alcohol, reclaim your clarity, and rewire the core of your habits?
UM takes a powerful, unconventional approach — tapping into your subconscious to reshape the patterns that drive your choices. Whether your goal is drink control or total sobriety, this program supports you in creating lasting change.


“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” — Carl Jung


Grounded in over a century of psychological research, this drink control program was developed by renowned psychologists Dr. John and Nada O'Brien. Over 90 days, you’ll embark on a transformative journey using hypnotherapy, journaling, guided movement, and meditative practice — unlocking real change where it starts: your unconscious mind.


✨ Your Tools for Lasting Change:

💭 Subconscious rewiring to help you let your bad habit break down and shift deep-rooted patterns
🧘 Guided meditations to calm your mind, reduce urges, and help you drink less alcohol
🛠️ Self-hypnosis drink tracker designed to support drink control and conscious choice
📚 Daily reflections and content to guide you through your smart recovery journey
📊 Track how you feel — and celebrate every step in becoming a true habit breaker


🌀 What Makes It Different?

Most drinking habits aren’t logical — they’re unconscious. That’s why traditional methods often fail to support a real bad habit break. In UM, alcohol isn’t treated as the problem, but rather the solution you’ve built to cope. This mindful smart recovery approach allows you to address the root cause gently, effectively, and without shame.

Become a true habit breaker with deep mental reprogramming that supports lasting change — whether you're aiming for total sobriety or just drink less alcohol. Help your bad habit break happen and begin your smart recovery.


🗓 Your Habit Breaker: 90-Day Journey


Month 1: Total Reset

No drinking — let your bad habit break. Each week, you’ll be guided through immersive hypnotherapy sessions that reveal the unconscious roots of your choices. You’ll begin your smart recovery, reframe inner dialogue, and rediscover life's pleasures with a fresh perspective. By day 30, you'll feel the power of this habit breaker in motion — like test-driving a Ferrari version of your future self.


Month 2: Conscious Choice

You can continue alcohol-free or explore drink control consciously. Either way, now YOU are a habit breaker, and you have the tools. If you choose to drink, our one-of-a-kind self-hypnosis drink tracker guides you with a 5-minute pre-session and hourly 1-minute check-ins to support you. Stay present, stay grounded, and always choose consciously — not compulsively.


Month 3: Lasting Integration

The final phase strengthens your transformation. By now, your habit breaker work has made a deep impact. You’ll experience more ease in maintaining your new relationship with alcohol and more freedom in every aspect of your life.


📚 Daily Educational Content

Each day brings a new theme to support your bad habit break, with reflections and journaling — all designed to help you drink less alcohol and stay grounded.


🌿 Movement for Mind-Body Balance

Gentle movement sessions designed to reconnect you with your body and support you on the journey to drink less alcohol.


🧘 Immersive Guided Meditations 🌿

These meditations support your smart recovery by calming your system and gently rewiring habits.


💡 A Mindful, Lasting Shift

Unconscious Moderation doesn’t ask you to fight cravings. It helps you change your wiring — so the cravings dissolve on their own. Through subconscious rewiring, drink control becomes intuitive. You’ll feel the shift not just in your habits, but in how you see yourself.

"DrinkControl – Make Sense of Your Drinks

DrinkControl goes beyond counting drinks — it helps you understand what they *really* mean. It helps you understand your alcohol consumption in a way that truly makes sense. Most people don't realize how much they’re drinking or how it compares to recommended guidelines. DrinkControl changes that by converting your drinks into standard alcohol units and showing you the bigger picture.

“Makes it clear that one glass of wine is not always ‘just one drink.’” – ★★★★★


Your Smart Alcohol Diary

More than a log — it’s your accountability partner. Track what, when, and how much you drink. Non-judgemental with full privacy (data stays on your device only). App helps you stay accountable and notice patterns in your drinking habits. Whether you're trying to cut back, stick to certain days, or simply stay more mindful, this app keeps you on track.

“This app helped me reduce my drinking by simply making me aware.” – ★★★★★


Not All Drinks Are Equal

We often think in glasses and bottles — not units. But not all beers, wines, or cocktails contain the same amount of alcohol. DrinkControl takes the guesswork out of the equation by converting every drink into standard alcohol units and grams of pure alcohol, based on real guidelines from health institutions.

“Really opens your eyes when you see how many units are in a few ‘innocent’ drinks.” – ★★★★★


Calories Count Too

Alcohol doesn’t just affect your liver — it affects your waistline too. Drinks are full of empty (without any nutritional value) calories. DrinkControl helps you stay aware of the calories in your drinks, making it easier to manage your weight, cut down for health reasons, or save money.

“This app helped me lose weight and drink less at the same time.” – ★★★★★

A little tracking goes a long way.


Top Features

- Quick logging of drinks and alcohol expenses
- Calendar view of your drinking patterns
- Mark dry days and build sober streaks
- Charts, trend-line and statistics on alcohol/calories consumed, money spent on drinks
- Compare your intake against global health guidelines

Whether you're sober-curious, cutting back, or just want to stay in control — DrinkControl is your personal alcohol awareness companion.


Real User Experiences

“I’ve just started my third year of using DrinkControl. Of course, this is a tool, not a magic bullet. Yet it has helped me help myself. I have halved my consumption each year, meaning this year I’m drinking 1/8(!!!) the amount I consumed 4yrs ago.“ – ★★★★★

“I’ve been tracking drinks with this app for quite awhile and did get the premium version to keep better track. It has really helped me to see how much I overconsume without even realizing it.“ – ★★★★★

“Wake up to yet another sober day under your belt and let this app celebrate you for it. This is your cheerleader to leading a life free from alcohol! Great app!“ – ★★★★★

WHAT IS MINDFUL DRINKING?


Put simply, it’s all about thinking while drinking. Mindful drinking is not about quitting alcohol but instead being aware of how much alcohol you’re drinking and its impact on you in the moment.



SCIENCE-BACKED FOR LASTING CHANGE


Reviewed and backed by an advisory board of medical and habit change experts, Sunnyside uses techniques such as pre-commitment and conscious interference to gradually help you reframe your relationship to alcohol without interrupting your day-to-day lifestyle.



NO GUILT OR PRESSURE TO QUIT


Our nonjudgmental approach will make you feel welcome and appreciated. Your goals around alcohol are personal–not all or nothing–and we tailor your experience appropriately. We never pressure you to be sober or quit drinking.



HOW IT WORKS


• Set your personal goals around alcohol

Your experience starts with a short, anonymous survey that only takes about 3 minutes. We gather some information about your drinking habits, your goals, and your intentions. This helps us personalize your experience to help you reframe your relationship to alcohol.


• Commit to a weekly alcohol plan

Every week we give you a recommended drink plan for the week ahead that will help you reach your personal goals. It’s always gradual and you can always adjust it.


• Track your drinks

Via a simple interface in-app (or via text message), we make alcohol tracking easy, and provide nudges to help you stay on target.


• Get daily motivation

We’ll deliver upbeat and positive education, motivation, tips, and tricks to keep you on track every day of the week. We focus on mindfulness and moderation, not going sober.


• Text real human coaches

Our team of real human coaches are available for you, no matter what you need. Text them anonymously to receive a helpful nudge at any time. Or don’t. We never force you to interact with our coaches.


• Interact with the community

Our new community feature lets you connect with others in the community around a shared daily prompt that helps you stay positive and mindful every day. It’s the perfect way to support those around you and get a bit of support and validation for yourself.


• Measure your progress

Watch and measure how your new habits add up to better sleep, money saved, and an improved diet in your personal dashboard.

"Bicycle Health is a digital health start-up that offers online Medication for Addiction Treatment (MAT) for individuals with Opioid Use Disorder.

The Opioid Epidemic is a systemic problem - millions of Americans are physically dependent on Opioids but only 10% of Americans have access to treatment. Bicycle Health is addressing this gap by offering personalized, affordable, and confidential treatment with the goal of helping individuals take back control of their lives.


What we provide

-Medication Management: A licensed provider will perform a via video call assessment and prescribe Buprenorphine - Naloxone, if appropriate and help taper it down over time.
-Counseling: Patients often have co-occurring depression, anxiety, trauma, etc. Our mental health providers have 1-1 video calls with patients to support their behavioral health needs.
-Support Groups: Our free Support Groups offer a platform for patients to share their journeys with others, support others, and reflect on ways to achieve emotional growth.
-Care Coordination: Through constant communication, our health coaches help patients navigate treatment and life changes as a partner, mentor, and support system.

Our Difference:

-We don’t take a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Our philosophy is centered around harm reduction - we cater care plans to meet each patient at their point of need.
-Same day appointments. Patients can start our program as soon as they are ready.
-We outreach to your patients. Just call, text, or email us if a patient or someone you know is in need of treatment. We will take care of the rest.
-Easy access. Patients can reach their doctor anytime, anywhere via text, chat, email, video, or phone and get a response within minutes.
-Affordable care. We accept United, Medicare, Cigna, Aetna, and Blue Shield of California (PPO). We also offer a self pay rate of $199/month.
-Progress and Outcomes: We have been live since Jan 2019, with positive outcomes:
-2,000+ patients served across the U.S. We are launching in new states weekly - check with us to see if we are available in your region!
-85% abstinence in drug use
-60% improvement in motivation, depression, and patient stress.

Our Technology:

The Bicycle Health mobile application is the primary treatment portal for our patients. Our patients can use our application to conduct video visits with their provider, view and reschedule upcoming appointments, view prescriptions and request refills, access treatment documents, submit toxicology screens, modify billing preferences, and communicate with our care team via secure messaging.

For more information and patient resources, please visit our website at: https://www.bicyclehealth.com/


NOTE: Our application on its own is not intended to provide medical advice; rather, it is designed to communicate the guidance of your medical provider. Please always follow the direction of your medical provider before making medical decisions.

Permissions

To provide you with video services for attending your provider visits and support groups, we integrate with a service called Zoom. The Zoom technology requires FOREGROUND_SERVICE permissions to provide the following capabilities :

- Allow the use of a Bluetooth device as the audio source for your provider visit
- Allow the capability for the app to receive audio when the app is put in the background should you need to navigate to other apps during a visit
- Allow the capability to share audio to your provider while screen sharing with them
- Allow the capability to project the screen while screen sharing","10,000+ downloads",,"Jul 22, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bicyclehealth.patient.app

The DASH Diet is for preventing and lowering hypertension, as well as encouraging natural healthy weight loss.

DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The main goal of the diet is to prevent and lower high blood pressure, although there are some other beneficial ""side-effects"" such as weight loss. It is a heart health recommended diet and the best for high blood pressure along with healthy weight loss.

The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. It also contains less salt and sodium; sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages; fats; and red meats than the typical American diet. This heart healthy way of eating is also lower in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol and rich in nutrients that are associated with lowering blood pressure—mainly potassium, magnesium, and calcium, protein, and fiber.

The DASH eating plan doesn't require any special foods or supplements like a lot of homeopathic diets. It simply calls for a certain number of daily servings from various food groups. The number of servings depends on the number of calories you’re allowed each day. Your calorie level depends on your age and, especially, how active you are. You will also limit your sodium levels to either 2300mg or 1500mg each day. The less salt you eat, the more you may be able to lower your blood pressure.

MyDashDiet encourages you to make your own health care decisions based upon your research and in partnership with a qualified health care professional.

WHAT IS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)?

OCD is a common psychiatric disorder that involves repetitive, unwanted thoughts that cause anxiety, and compulsive behaviors done in an attempt to reduce this anxiety.

IS NOCD THERAPY EFFECTIVE?

WHO ARE NOCD THERAPISTS?

NOCD’s extensive therapist network includes licensed counselors, psychologists, and social workers. Every NOCD Therapist receives specialty training in exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, the most effective OCD treatment.

"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may present with obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions and compulsions are often distressing, time-consuming, and impairing.

Everyone has worried about germs or losing something or someone getting hurt. These thoughts tend to be fleeting and do not disrupt daily living. If these thoughts are constantly occurring, uncontrollable, intrusive, and cause a lot of anxiety or stress, then they may be considered 'obsessions.'

Everyone has felt the need to double check that the door is locked or arrange items in a correct way. If you perform these actions like a ritual or with rigid rules in order to prevent or reduce anxious thoughts, or if these actions greatly disrupt your life, then they may be considered 'compulsions.'

This app is designed to evaluate your symptoms of OCD with a scientifically-supported 18-question test. It uses the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), a screening questionnaire for OCD that is commonly used in research and healthcare settings. The OCI-R is also helpful for monitoring your OCD-related symptoms during and after treatment.

OCD Test contains four tools:
- Start Test: take the OCI-R questionnaire to assess OCD symptoms
- History: see a history of your test scores to monitor your symptoms over time
- Information: learn about OCD and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery
- Reminder: set up notifications to re-take the questionnaire at your convenience

Disclaimer: The OCI-R is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. Please consult a physician or mental health professional if you are concerned about OCD.

"Sectograph is a time planner that visually displays a list of tasks and events for the day in the form of a 12-hour pie chart - a watch dial.
The application will help you sharpen your sense of time and allow you to visualize your day.

HOW IT WORKS

In short, it is a projection of your routine and tasks onto the clock face. It visualizes your day for precise timekeeping and offers you peace of mind.
The scheduler works like an analog clock face. It automatically fetches all the events from your Google calendar (or local calendar) and places them on a 12-hour sectored watch face. This technology can be called a ""Calendar clock"".

HOW IT LOOKS

The list of your calendar events is projected in the form of a pie chart in the application and on the home screen widget.
Events are sectors, the beginning and duration of which you can clearly track using special arcs to follow your plan.
A calendar and analog clock combined gives you an amazingly visual representation of your work, allowing you to effectively plan and calculate your day.

WHAT CAN THE APPLICATION BE USED FOR?

✔ Daily scheduling and visual timing. Track your daily tasks, agendas, appointments, and events in Sectograph, and at any time, find out how much time is left until the end of the current event and the start of the next one. Don't be late.
✔ Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in the docking station at your workstation and your office day plan is under control.
✔ Schedule of classes. Keep your phone close at hand and see how much time is left until the end of those tiring lectures – and never be late for lab work again.
✔ Self-organization at home. Your daily routine is now more convenient than ever. Remember to balance work, rest and physical activity, just use the app as an organizer for your home routine.
✔ Trip timer and flight duration. Do you lose track of time due to endless travel and flights? Visually control your check-in, landing and flight duration. Keep everything under control.
✔ Follow your meal schedule, medication schedule, exercise therapy, and other important activities. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!
✔ Convenient countdown of any lengthy scheduled events. Don't miss the end of your vacation and know exactly how many days are left until the end of your military service.
✔ Monitor everyday affairs on the go and in your car. Achieve your goals by keeping the application installed on the device.
✔ Time management using GTD technology. Is planning your day confusing? With the function of striking out or hiding flagged events, keep your chart as clean as possible. Sectograph will improve your time management.
✔ My goals. The app can be used to achieve goals from your Google calendar. It will help you with timekeeping, organize your day, and assist you in completing your goals on time.
✔ Attention-deficit. According to our users, the application is effective for attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD). If you are wasting time and have trouble concentrating on tasks, this app may be useful to you.
✔ The application will be useful for fans of the ""Chronodex"" concept. You can use the Sectograph as an analog of a paper diary used by this concept.
✔ Display doings from Microsoft Outlook calendar. (beta)

SMARTWATCH on Wear OS

Do you have a Wear OS smartwatch?
Great! Use the Sectograph tile or watch face. Now your smart watch will become an effective planner!

HOME SCREEN WIDGET

Use the day planner widget on your device's home screen.
The widget automatically updates events and its clock once a minute, as well as after any new events appear in the calendar.
You can view details of the event on the widget and access some of its options by clicking on the corresponding sector.

"oVRcome helps get your phobias and anxieties under control, so you can live a happier, healthier, more relaxed life. Developed by clinical psychologists, it delivers safe, effective, and quick results with guided VR exposure therapy and coping strategies.

Clinical Trial published here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00048674221110779

Why download oVRcome?
If you have a phobia that stops you living life the way you want to, oVRcome makes it easy for you to learn powerful skills that help manage your reactions and lessen that heart-beaty, stomach-churny feeling you get when you’re terrified of something.

Once you’ve mastered some skills you can use to calm yourself down when you’re anxious, you’re guided into exposure therapy - the global gold standard in treating phobias. This means, you’ll be in an immersive environment with your fears, but they can’t harm you because they’re not actually there. Now you can practice calming down and conquer your fears in the privacy, convenience, and comfort of your own home!

oVRcome can be accessed via a subscription, that is a fraction of the cost that you would spend visiting a clinician in real life. Whether it’s a fear of spiders you feel is becoming more obvious, or worries about how to talk to people and be appropriately social; oVRcome can help bring more calm into your life. Working on your mental health can be difficult because psychologists, therapists, and counsellors can be very expensive. They also often have waiting lists a mile long. With oVRcome, you’ll be guided to positive, permanent change with a very minimal cost.

oVRcome has been developed in a clinical setting, backed by a robust body of academically accepted, evidence based, peer reviewed literature. It encapsulates the inner workings of psychological theory and proven methodology, delivered in a user friendly, intuitive, and calming package. Best of all, oVRcome is immediately accessible through the convenience, familiarity, and simplicity of your smartphone.

"The Bar Bending Schedule (BBS) calculator app is a specialized tool catering to civil engineers involved in reinforcement cement concrete projects. Its primary function is to facilitate the preparation of steel reinforcement bar bending details with utmost simplicity and efficiency.

The app streamlines the process through a straightforward workflow, encompassing three intuitive steps. Firstly, engineers can easily sketch the shape of the steel reinforcement bar by directly interacting with the app's canvas interface. This allows for precise visualization and layout customization.

Secondly, users input specific reinforcement details, such as the diameter of the concrete rebar and the desired number of bars. This information serves as essential parameters for accurate calculations within the app.

Lastly, with a single press of the BBS button, the app instantaneously generates a comprehensive bar bending schedule. This schedule encompasses vital information regarding the placement, dimensions, and configuration of the steel reinforcement bars. It provides clear instructions to guide rebar benders on-site, facilitating efficient and precise implementation.

Moreover, the app includes a robust metal weight calculator that accurately determines the per meter weight of the steel reinforcement. By inputting the diameter of the rebar, engineers obtain precise weight measurements, aiding in material planning and estimation.

The canvas feature of the app serves as an invaluable tool for rebar detailing. It enables engineers to effortlessly visualize the reinforcement structure, ensuring accuracy and effective communication among project stakeholders.

It is important to emphasize that the app's purpose is specifically tailored to steel reinforcement and rebar detailing. While it excels in these areas, it is not intended for comprehensive structural steel calculations. The BBS calculator app significantly simplifies the complex task of preparing bar bending schedules, offering an intuitive and indispensable tool for civil engineers engaged in reinforcement cement concrete projects.","100,000+ downloads","Apr 2, 2017","Mar 28, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thepracticalcivilengineer.barbendingschedule.basic

"Intermittent Fasting 16:8 will guide you to a new lifestyle with healthy habits. You’ll lose weight effectively and feel more active! No diet and no yo-yo effect.

IS IT EFFECTIVE?
It’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's ""fat-burning"" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.

IS IT SAFE?
Yes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

CAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?
With various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women. It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it. If you are under 18 years old, pregnant or breastfeeding, have health issues or are underweight, please ask your doctor for advice before fasting.

"Choiceful guides you through OCD episodes, just like an OCD therapist would in session.

**How does it work?**
Just write down what's bothering you and Choiceful's AI therapy chat session provides step-by-step therapeutic guidance. It's powered by AI, so it's 100% personalized to what you’re dealing with in the moment. Specifically, it’ll help you to…
- Identify and resist your compulsive urges.
- Defuse from intrusive thoughts & feelings.
- Choose to live your life on your terms, not OCD’s.

**Isn’t this an AI therapist?**
No, and we’ll never try to replace a therapist. We’re an AI-enabled therapy tool that provides in-the-moment support.

**What does “choiceful” mean?**
Living with OCD can feel impossible. But no matter how overwhelming your intrusive thoughts, anxiety and compulsive urges are, you have the power to choose. Being choiceful means practicing this power and living life on your own terms, not OCD’s. This app is made to cultivate that skill and choiceful way of living. Be choiceful!

Our favorite quote is by Viktor Frankl - “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In that choice lies our growth and our freedom.”

**Where does my data go?**
We take your privacy very seriously. OCD is a very sensitive and personal disorder. As OCD sufferers ourselves, we know that from our personal experience. All your personal data is encrypted and securely protected, meaning we NEVER ""read"" what you write. Ever.

**Who are you?**
I’m Brian and my life was turned upside down 10 years ago when I got stuck on my first intrusive thought. It’s been a long battle since then, but now I’m on a mission to make OCD treatment should be accessible and affordable to everyone.

**Do I need to pay?**
No! Choiceful is free to use - you can submit 5 entries per week. If you need unlimited entries per week, you can get Choiceful Pro for $5.99/mo. We believe in making OCD care accessible to everyone, so if you require financial aid, please send an email to finaid@bechoiceful.com.

**MEDICAL DISCLAIMER**
Although Choiceful is an AI-powered OCD therapy support app, it is NOT providing therapy itself NOR is it meant to replace a therapist. Instead, it’s to be another tool in your OCD support toolkit. Although we know it's not feasible for many sufferers, we still recommend this app be used as a tool under OCD clinical supervision. If you have any questions, please send us an email at support@bechoiceful.com

"This application approximates the length of exposure for various B&W films (and some color films) in low light situations. In low light, extra exposure is needed due to reciprocity failure (also known as the Schwarzschild effect). As such, your camera's meter is not accurate in low light. This application approximates the proper exposure time (based upon manufacturers datasheets). A timer is now included in the application.

The application warns when the user enters an exposure longer than described in manufacturer's datasheets. Although the exposure in these instances is crudely approximated by mathematical extrapolation, it is crucial that users conduct their own exposure tests in these very long exposure situations.

"With our Noise Exposure App you can estimate the noise level around you. Use it to measure noise at work, in your car or at your local sporting event.

In the Noise Exposure App you can:
• Measure sound levels in real time.
• Save and compare measurements over time.
• Share measurements with others.
• Learn about noise levels and regulations.

How does the app work?
Hold the phone so that you point it away from your body. Direct the microphone at the bottom of your phone towards the noise that you wish to measure. Start measuring by tapping the button ”Measure”. The app will keep measuring until you tap ”Stop”. Once finished, you will see the average value for your measurement. You can then choose to save and name your measurement. You will also have the option to share it with your friends or colleagues. You can also share the measurements later.

In the app you will find useful information about noise levels and regulations. You can also visit our website for more information about noise, regulations and when noise becomes harmful to you.

Measuring noise with the noise exposure app will give you a good indication of the noise levels around you – for example at your workplace. Due to the limitations of the phone, the app does not fulfil European or international standards for sound level meters.

If your measurement shows that the sound levels are too high, we recommend you proceed by doing more accurate measurements with professional equipment. Android phones generally measure sounds well between 40 dB(A) and 80 dB(A). But the microphones can differ in quality. Always use a professional sound level meter if you want accurate results.

If you experience high sound levels at your workplace, the first thing you should do is to talk to your employer. The employer is responsible for your work environment. This includes taking preventative measures to ensure that the sound levels are not harmful to you or others.

Visit our website to see how we have tested and adjusted the app to each model.

"Sound Oasis® is the world leader in sound therapy systems.We take tinnitus therapy seriously and it is our hope that this application will provide relief for your tinnitus symptoms. This Lite version of the app provides a sampling of our effective tinnitus relief sounds, a fully functional playback timer, and soft-off volume management.

In the Pro version, there are a wide variety of sounds to choose from and it features a 10-band equalizer that allows you to customise the sound frequencies to your personal needs.

How Does This APP Work?

The sounds in this app can be an effective tool to manage your tinnitus using sound therapy and sound masking to make tinnitus symptoms less noticeable. This masking effect can be particularly effective at night when the surrounding environment is quieter. By listening to pleasant sounds, particularly sounds close to the frequency level of your tinnitus symptoms, your brain will predominantly hear the pleasant sound instead of the annoying tinnitus noise.

"This app was designed and created by Eimear and Aoife, two specialist Pelvic Health Physiotherapists, to support Mums through their postnatal recovery. With a combined experience of 20 years helping women after childbirth, we recognise that Mothers need more support to guide them through the changes in their body after pregnancy. In the UK and Ireland, on average 12 medical appointments are offered in pregnancy, but only one postnatal check-up for Mum!
Although experts in postnatal care, we are also Mothers who have been through this journey and understand how vulnerable and unprepared you can feel. Pregnancy and delivery takes it toll on the body, but when baby arrives Mum’s recovery often takes a back seat. This app provides Mothers with the advice and support we feel they deserve. Including pelvic floor reminders and 84 daily videos focusing on pelvic floor rehabilitation, general strengthening to help your body meet the demands of motherhood and advice from a team of medical professionals to help guide you through the 4th trimester.
No topic is off limits, we talk about constipation, sex, leaking, hormones, prolapse,farting, diastasis, back pain and return to exercise after birth. We discuss each of these openly and honestly to normalise what women may experience after birth, and offer practical and professional advice that many mums need after delivery.
A number of other women’s health experts feature within the app. Topics they cover include skin changes after pregnancy, coping with parenting, postnatal mental health, stitches care, pain management, bleeding, tears explained, nutrition, birth trauma, hemorrhoids, contraceptives, smear tests and hair loss.
The app also includes 30 rehabilitation sessions led by women’s health Physiotherapists, to reconnect your core, strengthen your pelvic floor and prepare your body for the daily demands of motherhood. And for those interested in returning to exercise, these sessions will help you on your way.
The importance of pelvic floor exercises cannot be underestimated after pregnancy but when baby arrives its hard to find the time or even remember to do them. This is why the app also includes a daily reminder for pelvic floor rehab and numerous videos on how to do them correctly.

"You've brought your baby home and you're ready to get back to your pre-pregnancy form.

Our workouts are specifically created for new moms looking to build and strengthen their muscles after birth.
These gentle exercises are perfect for easing your postnatal body into an exercise routine.
Following a safe and effective postnatal workout plan will get you on the right track to becoming a happy and healthy new mom.

Getting your body back post-baby isn't easy, but this postpartum exercise app is a great starting point. Postnatal exercise can help with weight loss and psychological wellbeing. It can also hasten recovery, and assist with muscle strength and toning. Postnatal exercises are important for you to regain the strength of your abdominal muscles, after the birth of your baby.

Just because you are a mum does not mean you cannot be fit. Finding time to train however is difficult. If you have to think about carving time to get to the gym, train, get back, shower and still fit in all the demands of being a mother then things become truly challenging.

One way to regain stability and heal pregnancy-related abdominal issues is through postnatal core workouts.
Postpartum belly fat: we added exercises for a flat belly post pregnancy in just 30 days. You've heard Kegels mentioned from time to time, but just what are these exercises, and what do they do? These invisible exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, and they are great to do both during and after pregnancy. Women who perform Kegel exercises during pregnancy may have an easier time during childbirth because strengthening the pelvic muscles can help a woman control those muscles during labor and delivery

Features :
- Records training progress automatically
- A total of 5 workouts and multiple 30-day challenges
- Create your own workouts
- Increases exercise intensity step by step

Track and analyze your bowel movements effortlessly with Poop Tracker. Print your stool analysis to easily share with your doctor.

Understand the significance of stool consistency, color, frequency, and urgency. Track and analyze these stats over time to identify potential issues like IBS or Crohn's disease.

Poop Tracker uses the Bristol Stool Scale to assess stool quality and allows you to monitor your bowel movement data across all toilet journal entries.

Poop Tracker Features:

Why Track Your Bowel Movements?

Tracking your bathroom habits with a toilet log helps monitor stool health over time and uncover chronic issues like IBS, Crohn's disease, colitis, celiac disease, chronic diarrhea, or constipation by identifying patterns and irregularities.

If you have a chronic bowel condition, maintaining a bathroom log can monitor symptom severity and disease progression, making it easy to share data with your doctor.

About the Bristol Stool Scale:

The Bristol Stool Scale (BSF scale) is a medical tool that classifies human stool into seven categories. It's used in clinical and experimental settings and is known as the Meyers scale in the UK. Poop Tracker uses this scale to track stool type, as it is the most developed standard for categorizing feces.

"The BPD Insight and Awareness app is an essential resource for gaining a more thorough, fact-based understanding of borderline personality disorder. This comprehensive app provides a wealth of information and resources for individuals affected by BPD, along with loved ones, family members, and friends.

It begins with an in-depth description of BPD and the nine BPD symptoms. A historical overview of the disorder is presented, tracing its origins in 1938, when Adolf Stern first introduced the term ""borderline,"" up to May of 2008, when the US House of Representatives recognized May as National BPD Awareness Month.

In addition to presenting content on the symptoms, treatments, and possible causes of the disorder, the app presents dozens of brief pieces of original content on aspects of BPD that don't get enough attention—things like the difficulty people with BPD have with ""object constancy,"" ""identity disturbance,"" and ""emotional reasoning."" Whenever possible, the content is written using plain, non-clinical language.

There is a considerable emphasis in the app on DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), including its origin in the 1970s when Marsha Linehan developed it. The app provides a detailed explanation of DBT and how it differs from other types of psychotherapy. In addition, the four essential skills of DBT are explained not only in writing but also with DBT skills sheets and video presentations.

This app provides access to some of the most popular BPD blogs and links to the most reputable sources of information on BPD, such as NEABPD, NIMH, NAMI, and more. It includes powerful mindfulness meditation videos created specifically for individuals with BPD, multimedia presentations, audio tracks, inspiring music, famous BPD quotes, and powerful affirmations.

The app includes three BPD self-assessments commonly used in the diagnosis of BPD, including the highly regarded McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD) and the lesser-known BSL-23

This app will present information on BPD using clear, intelligible language and provide information thoughtfully and sensitively, with an emphasis on hope and recovery.

The BPD Insight and Awareness App includes:

An Introduction from the Developer
A Definition and Description of BPD

The Cause of BPD as Represented in the Biosocial Theory

"BPPV Relief: Your Educational Guide to Understanding and Managing Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a common condition affecting the inner ear's balance system, leading to dizziness and vertigo. This educational tool is designed to help both health professionals and patients better understand BPPV through easy-to-follow animations that demonstrate commonly recommended diagnostic tests and treatment maneuvers.

Key Features:

Educational Animations: Our animations visually guide you through the diagnostic tests for the posterior and horizontal canals, highlighting the direction of eye movements (nystagmus) associated with a positive test. This feature is intended to enhance the ability of health professionals to detect and interpret nystagmus in a clinical setting.

Treatment Visualization: The animations also demonstrate the most commonly used treatment maneuvers, showing how the semicircular canals move in tandem with head movements. These visual aids are designed to enhance understanding of the repositioning process, as crystals within the ear are guided out of the canal during treatment.

Who is This App For?

Health Professionals Specializing in Dizziness and Vertigo: The app serves as a valuable resource for those who specialize in diagnosing and treating BPPV.

General Health Professionals: Those who encounter patients with dizziness and vertigo can use this app as a supplementary educational tool to deepen their understanding of BPPV.

Health Professional Educators: The app is an excellent teaching tool for those training others in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV.

Patients Under Professional Care: For patients diagnosed with BPPV by a qualified health professional, this app can reinforce understanding of their condition and the maneuvers prescribed as part of their treatment regimen. It is intended to be used only under the guidance and care of a healthcare provider.

Important Note:

This app is an educational resource and is not intended to diagnose or treat BPPV. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We strongly recommend consulting with a qualified health professional before using this app.

Developer Background:

BPPV Relief was developed by an experienced physiotherapist who has successfully treated over 2,000 patients with BPPV. The app is based on the same evidence-based practices and techniques used in a clinical setting, following the guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.",5.1 and up,Burston Software,1.9,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burstonsoftware.BppvRelief

"Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition characterized by difficulty managing emotions and behavior, a pattern of unstable relationships, and self-image issues. Individuals with borderline personality disorder often engage in self-harm and deal with feelings of emptiness, fear of abandonment, and depersonalization.

Borderline Personality Disorder is commonly associated with other mental health conditions such as depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse.

BPD can typically be treated with evidence-based psychotherapy such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).

"With ImageMeter, you can annotate your photos with length measurements, angles, areas, and text notes. That is much easier and self-explaining than drawing only a sketch. Take photos in buildings to plan construction work and insert the required measurements and notes directly into the picture. Organize and export the images directly on your phone or tablet.


ImageMeter has the broadest support for Bluetooth laser distance measurement devices. Most devices from various manufacturers are supported (see below for list of devices).


A special feature is that ImageMeter enables you to measure within the image once you calibrated it with a reference object of known size. With this feature, you can also easily measure the dimensions for places which are too difficult to reach or hard to measure for other reasons. ImageMeter can take care of all perspective foreshortening and can still compute the measurements correctly.


Features (Pro version):
- measure lengths, angles, circles, and arbitrarily shaped areas based on a single reference measure,
- Bluetooth connectivity to laser distance meters for measuring lengths, areas, and angles,
- metric and imperial units (decimal and fractional inches),
- add text notes,
- freehand drawing, draw basic geometric shapes,
- export to PDF, JPEG and PNG,
- adjust brightness, contrast and saturation for better readbility of your annotations,
- draw sketches on empty canvases,
- model-scale mode (show original sizes and scaled size for building models),
- show values in imperial and metric units simultaneously,
- context sensitive cursor snapping to draw quickly and accurately,
- fast and correct value input with autocompletion,
- measure the height of poles using two reference markings on the pole.


Features of Advanced Annotation Add-On:
- import PDF, measure drawings at scale,
- audio notes, picture-in-picture for detail images,
- draw measurement strings and cumulative strings,
- sort your images into subfolders with color codes.


Business version features:
- automatically upload your photos to your OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, or Nextcloud account,
- access your photos from your desktop PC,
- backup and synchronize the images automatically between multiple devices,
- generate data tables of your measurements,
- export data tables for your spreadsheet program,
- add data tables into exported PDF.


Supported bluetooth laser distance meters:
- Leica Disto D110, D810, D510, S910, D2, X4,
- Leica Disto D3a-BT, D8, A6, D330i,

"⭐ Personality Tester – Discover Your True Self & Unlock Your Potential ⭐
Uncover the Real You with Our Comprehensive Personality Test!

Based on the renowned Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and inspired by Carl Jung’s psychological theories, our app offers an insightful and engaging personality assessment. This powerful self-discovery tool helps you understand your strengths, weaknesses, ideal career paths, and how you connect with others. Whether you’re looking to enhance your personal growth, improve your relationships, or choose the right career, Personality Tester provides you with the tools and insights to thrive.

🧠 What Is the 16 Personalities Test?
This self-assessment is based on Carl Jung’s conceptual theory, further developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. Jung’s framework suggests that people experience the world through four primary cognitive functions:

Sensation (S) or Intuition (N) – How you process information
Thinking (T) or Feeling (F) – How you make decisions
Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I) – How you direct your energy
Judging (J) or Perceiving (P) – How you approach the outside world
These preferences combine to form 16 distinct personality types, categorized into four groups:

🔹 Analysts: INTJ (Architect), INTP (Logician), ENTJ (Commander), ENTP (Visionary)
🔹 Diplomats: INFJ (Advocate), INFP (Mediator), ENFJ (Protagonist), ENFP (Campaigner)
🔹 Sentinels: ISTJ (Logistician), ISFJ (Defender), ESTJ (Executive), ESFJ (Consul)
🔹 Explorers: ISTP (Virtuoso), ISFP (Adventurer), ESTP (Entrepreneur), ESFP (Entertainer)

A normal heartbeat rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM).

If your heartbeat is consistently above 100 beats per minute or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heartbeat is below 60 beats a minute, you you may seek medical advice.

WARNNING
- Heart dysrhythmias app should not be used as a medical device.

"Personality and Psychology Tests is a perfect app for those who want to check their character through quick, accurate and easy psychological personality tests and quizzes. These mini assessments feature 5-6 questions each and are grouped into several categories.
Personality Traits and Psychology: This category includes tests designed to explore various aspects of an individual's character, behavior, and mental processes. These tests delve into core attributes, belief systems, and interpersonal tendencies, offering insights into how one perceives the world and interacts with others. They cover a broad spectrum, from measuring specific traits like curiosity and maturity to assessing adherence to social norms and susceptibility to group influence.
Anxiety and Mental Health: This category focuses on self-assessments related to potential mental health concerns, anxieties, and behavioral patterns that may indicate underlying issues. These tests can help individuals recognize tendencies toward perfectionism, addiction, hypersensitivity, and other challenges that may warrant further exploration or professional mental health counseling.
Spirituality and Consciousness: This category includes tests centered on exploring an individual's spiritual beliefs, level of awareness, and connection to something greater than themselves. These self-evaluations delve into philosophical alignments, the strength of one's karma, and progress toward inner liberation. They may also touch upon esoteric concepts, altered states of consciousness, and the ability to discern authentic spiritual guidance.
Philosophical Currents and Topics: This category encompasses tests that explore an individual's alignment with various philosophical traditions, systems of thought, and cultural beliefs. These assessments delve into one's understanding of different philosophies, ranging from Eastern traditions like Taoism and Buddhism to Western ideologies like Stoicism and Gnosticism.

"Tonal Tinnitus Therapy can help you when you suffer from tonal tinnitus. The app guides you through the configuration process. It creates therapy sounds in a continuous stream without any interruptions.

It is based on the principles of acoustic neuromodulation. You can read about it at: https://content.iospress.com/articles/restorative-neurology-and-neuroscience/rnn110218 Tonal Tinnitus Therapy cannot be used when your Tinnitus tone has a frequency above 15000 Hz. Using acoustic neuromodulation above 10000 Hz is an unknown area, but if you have such a high Tinnitus tone, you can try the therapy using Tonal Tinnitus Therapy.

Some people really benefit from it, others don't notice any difference. Experiences can be found on the Internet.

If you suffer from hyperacusis, then be careful when using the app. Start with a few short periods of usage on a very low volume. When the therapy tones cause negative effects, don't continue using the app.

In addition to the therapy tones, you can add masking white noise, pink noise, violet (purple) noise or brown noise to make it more pleasant. You can also use the masking noise without the therapy tones by lowering the therapy tones volume to zero.

The app is not free, but it offers a one week trial period. After that, you need to pay once for unlimited usage or you can start a subscription.

Usage is simple: first find the frequency of your most dominant Tinnitus tone. The app plays the selected frequency and you can change the frequency until it matches your tone. Don't do this too quickly, it is absolutely necessary to find the right frequency. You can always check again if you have the right frequency selected.

The app configures four therapy tones, two below and two above your Tinnitus tone. Acoustic neuromodulation uses these therapy tones in series of twelve with a short time interval to reset your Tinnitus tone. Before you start playing these series of therapy tones, you must check if you hear every therapy tone at the same volume. You can adapt the volume of every therapy tone if needed. Then you can start playing the therapy tones. While playing you can change the volume for left and right channel in the main screen. You can close the main screen and reopen it whenever you want. Playing the therapy tones happens in the background, you see the app icon in the notification bar while it is running.

It is recommended to listen every day for at least four hours to the therapy tones. The app shows every day how much time you already listened. Some people notice positive effects after one day, others after several weeks or months and others never.

When you use a headset and you unplug the headset, the app will pause playing. When you connect the headset again, the app will continue playing.

Usage of this app is at your own risk. Read on the Internet about Acoustic Neuromodulation before you start using the app. If the app has unpleasant effects, stop immediately using it.

"This free test, 16 personalities indicator, is an introspective self-report questionnaire with the purpose of indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions.

This kind of test was constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers.

It is based on the conceptual theory proposed by Carl Jung, who had speculated that humans experience the world using four principal psychological functions (sensation, intuition, feeling, thinking) and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time.

The theory of personality types contends that: An individual is either primarily Extraverted(E) or Introverted(I), either primarily Sensing(S) or Intuitive(N), either primarily Thinking(T) or Feeling(F), either primarily Judging(J) or Perceiving(P).
The possible combinations of the basic preferences form 16 different Personality Types:
• Analysts: INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP
• Diplomats: INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP
• Sentinels: ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ
• Explorers: ISTP, ESFP, ESTP, ESFP

Learning about our personality type helps us to understand why certain areas in life come easily to us, and others are more of a struggle.

Learning about other people’s personality types help us to understand the most effective way to communicate with them, and how they function best.

Practical Use

The knowledge of our and other people’s personality types help us in different areas:
• Career - What types of tasks are we most suited to perform? Where are we naturally most happy?
• Managing Employees - How can we best understand an employee’s natural capabilities, and where they will find the most satisfaction?
• Interpersonal Relationships - How can we improve our awareness of other individuals personality type, and therefore increase our understanding of their reactions to situations, and know how to communicate with them effectively, on a level they best understand?
• Education - How can we develop different teaching methods to educate different types of people effectively?
• Counseling - How we can help individuals understand themselves better, and become better able to deal with their strengths and weaknesses?","100,000+ downloads",,"Jul 2, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.digerati.personalitytest

"Becoming a mother is a wonderful experience, but it can also leave you feeling tired, drained and with an after-pregnancy belly. However, you don't have to let motherhood take over your fitness routine. Here are some postnatal workouts you can do to help you get back in shape and feel confident in your own skin.

Yoga is a great workout option for new mothers. Not only does it help you lose weight, but it also promotes flexibility and stress relief. Start with gentle poses like cat-cow, downward-facing dog, and warrior two. As you progress, you can gradually increase the difficulty of the poses. Yoga is also an excellent way to target the abdominal muscles, helping you tone your after-pregnancy belly.

Pilates is another excellent postnatal workout option that can help you get back in shape. It's low-impact, which means it's gentle on your joints and can help you avoid injury. Pilates can help you build strength, improve posture, and reduce stress. Some popular pilates exercises include the pelvic tilt, the clam, and the bridging. As you get stronger, you can increase the difficulty of the exercises.

Cardio is an important part of any fitness routine, and postnatal workouts are no exception. You can start with gentle activities like walking, swimming, or cycling. As you get stronger, you can increase the intensity of your cardio workouts. Cardio can help you lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health, and boost your energy levels.

Along with exercise, diet and hydration play an important role in postnatal weight loss. Aim to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, and avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.

Becoming a mother doesn't mean you have to give up your fitness routine. With the right postnatal workouts and a balanced diet, you can get back in shape, lose weight, and feel confident in your own skin. So, whether you prefer yoga, pilates, or cardio, get moving and start feeling like your best self.","10,000+ downloads",powerpunch - data driven workout programs,"Nov 10, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.powerpunch.postnatal

"Whether you're slowly finding your fitness groove post-baby or want to spice up a workout rut, a 30-day challenge is a great answer to both.
Returning to exercise postpartum varies from woman to woman. It depends on how active you were before and during your pregnancy.

Kegel exercises after delivery can heal your pelvic floor and relieve discomfort. The right time to start kegel exercises depends on the type of delivery you had and how active you were during pregnancy. Use Kegels to strengthen pelvic floor muscles after pregnancy and get fit in 30 days.

Home Workout Plan for Weight Loss and Toning
Following a safe and effective postnatal workout plan will get you on the right track to becoming a happy and healthy new mom.

Even minor parenting tasks like carrying your diaper bag and running after your toddler can make your body stiff and achy. Our stretching plan targets the spots that bug moms most. One of the things you might not hear about postpartum is how much your back will hurt. It turns out, the “new mom backache” is absolutely a thing. And it’s no wonder—your body has been through a lot. Specifically, your abdominal muscles. There are a few back pain exercises that will help to relieve back pain.

Just because you are a mum does not mean you cannot be fit. Finding time to train as a busy mother is difficult. If you have to think about carving time to get to the gym, train, get back, shower and still fit in all the demands of being a mother then things become truly challenging. This app will help you come up with a home workout schedule for women from Monday through Sunday each week for 30 days long. This is the best home workout schedule for beginners to lose weight and get back in shape. Before you set up your weekly workout plan for women, you must make sure that you are eating healthy and getting the proper nutrition.

One thing most mums are keen to do after giving birth is to get back into shape, or even just back into exercising. Ready to get started? Check out these exercises to get you moving again and back to your normal routine in no time!

All the workout challenges increases the exercise intensity step by step and comes with multiple difficulty levels. The best way to get your bum back after pregnancy is to train your glute muscles with the right exercises. We offer glute exercises to get your curves back after pregnancy.

How Can I Improve My Postpartum Belly?
It can be hard to process the changes that happen before, during, and after pregnancy. Your body and life change in new and exciting ways. You have a new baby, new responsibilities, and a new body. One area you might feel tempted to work on improving after delivery is your postpartum belly. Over time, your postpartum belly will lessen on its own. However, there are ways you can improve your postpartum belly at home. Try to add (abdominal) exercises to your daily routine. Start with light body weight exercises like a plank.

The app provides effective and efficient muscle building and fat loss workouts. Become a fit mom in the comfort of your own home.

Features:
- Records training progress automatically
- A total of 8 challenges. Train your pelvic floor or do some relaxing yoga poses.
- Create your own challenge
- Increases exercise intensity & difficulty step by step. Very suitable for beginners.

"After giving birth, you may still have some fat and weight leftover you can get rid of. Burn off excess baby weight with help from a professional fitness trainer.

Losing the baby weight: many women wonder how long it takes to lose baby weight and bounce back to a pre-baby body. While many of us wish we could magically lose all those extra pregnancy pounds the moment baby finally arrives, the fact is no one snaps right back to her pre-baby body so quickly.

Though you may be eager to jump into a workout program or diet, easing into light exercise is crucial for keeping your body safe and injury-free. Even the fittest moms may have trouble getting back to exercise. After all, having a baby is a major ordeal and something you'll need time to recover from. You'll need clearance from your doctor and, depending on what kind of birth you had, it may be 4 to 8 weeks before you can engage in serious exercise.

But getting your body back after having a baby is not as hard as you might think.
Research shows that starting a regular exercise program soon after giving birth is not only good for your overall health, but may also help reduce the risk of postpartum depression.

This workout programs uses pure bodyweight exercises to safely get your body back into exercise after having a baby. Get your heart rate up for cardio for weight loss, as well as strengthen to tone and tighten your muscles. We added options for all fitness levels.

Getting flatter abs involves losing overall body fat with a combination of cardio, strength training, and a healthy diet. Even then, you may still have a little fat around the lower belly. This is an area many women store excess fat, particularly after pregnancy, so try not to put too much pressure on yourself to get a flat belly.

"Hemi Sync Binaural Beats has been dedicated to everyone who's under stress, who's in need of a friend to bring some joy and entertainment for him/her. Binaural beats Team provides you all with music that can impact you in a positive way as we believe binaural beats music is the best stress relieving and healing vibes that can change lives.

Binaural beats are the best way of relaxing your mind using the power of music. This works because of the fact that our brain communicates by generating electricity. These are called the brain waves. Our brain generates a specific brain waves for specific emotions. This is called the brain wave state. According to the scientific research each of our emotions can be associated with these brainwave states. Experts differ these waves into five types based on the frequency of 40 Hz to 1500 Hz.

Binaural beats are namely Delta waves, Theta waves, Alpha waves, Beta waves and Gamma waves. They each help you to reach a special state that you desire. The Delta waves helps you in better sleep. So, if you have any problem while sleeping you can go into deep sleep listening to it. If you are feeling tired, stressed or in anxiety then Theta waves will help you to get in deep relaxation, emotional connection and creativity. Alpha waves are used to feel relaxed and Gamma are used to make you feel hig.

We compose instrumental music that is specially designed to encourage and enhance relaxation, meditation, brain function and concentration, spa and massage therapy, healing music therapy and hypnosis therapy. In addition, we use binaural beats (Delta Waves, Alpha Waves, Theta Waves, Beta Waves & Gamma Waves) to naturally encourage a state of relaxation which is perfect for concentration, meditation, relaxation,stress relief or deep sleep.

Since 2014 we have been providing various Binaural Beat tracks and instrumental music to heal and encourage meditation and aware people about its benefits. Each and every tracks on our APP unique, it takes several hours to compose an Audio track. Then it takes several hours to render the video.

After years of research our sound waves are carefully designed to help you heal psychological problems, reduce stress, relax mind, reduce pain, improve mood, and many more.

Listening to Binaural Beats or Isochronic Tones are powerful methods to relax or stimulate the brain for meditation, concentration or sleep. Even more powerful are videos with a combination of Binaural Beats and Isochronic Tones. You can easily get access to your subconscious brain, study and get into a deep state of meditation. The only thing you have to do is listen to them with headphones or ear buds.

Binaural beats are an auditory illusion where two tones of different frequencies are heard in each ear. Due to the frequency difference, the brain perceives a third tone, the binaural beat. This binaural beat has the frequency of the difference between the other two tones.

For example, if you hear a 50Hz tone in the right ear and a 40Hz one in the left ear, the binaural beat has a 10Hz frequency. The brain tends to follow and synchronize with the binaural beat or isochronic tones, the Frequency Following Response (FFR).

5 main types of brain waves: :

Delta Brainwave : 0.1 Hz - 3 HZ, This will help you have better deep sleep.

Theta Brainwave : 4 Hz - 7 Hz, It contribute to improved meditation, creativity, and sleep in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase.

Alpha Brainwave : 8 Hz - 15 Hz, may encourage relaxation.

Beta Brainwave : 16 Hz - 30 Hz, This frequency range may help promote concentration and alertness.

"What do you Fear? Find out from our extensive list of Phobias, the inner fears that have been troubling you all these years. Maybe you hate spiders or large crowds ,find out what Phobia you have.

Phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.

Specific phobias should be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves. Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with some combination of counselling and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.

What happens when your fears begin to take over? Fear can control your life and keep you from following your dreams, prevent you from taking risks, and stop you from living the life that you want and doing the things which you desire.

"Depth of Field (DOF) is the range of distance in a photo that appears to be in sharp focus ... Depth of field is a creative decision and one of your most important choices when composing nature photographs.

This Depth of Field calculator allows you to calculate :

• Near limit of acceptable sharpness
• Far limit of acceptable sharpness
• Total depth of field length
• Hyperfocal distance

The calculation relies on :

• Camera model or Circle of Confusion
• Lens focal length (ex: 50mm)
• Aperture / f-stop (ex: f/1.8)
• Distance to Subject

Depth of Field definition :

Given a critical focus achieved for the plane located at the Subject distance, the Depth of Field is the extended area in front of and behind that plane that will appear reasonably sharp. It could be considered as a region of adequat focus.

Hyperfocal Distance definition :

Hyperfocal distance is the lowest Subject distance for a given camera setting (aperture, focal length) for which Depth of Field extends to infinity.

In documentary or street photography, the distance to the subject is often unknown in advance, while the need to react quickly remains essential. Using hyperfocal distance allows for presetting the focus to achieve a sufficiently wide depth of field that covers likely subjects. This approach is especially useful for manual focusing, either when autofocus is unavailable or when one chooses not to rely on it. In landscape photography, hyperfocal focusing is valuable for maximizing depth of field—either by achieving the greatest possible range for a given aperture or by determining the minimum aperture needed to keep both the foreground and infinity in acceptable focus.","50,000+ downloads",PixelProse SARL,"May 21, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.avianey.dof

The effectiveness of ZeroPhobia has been tested in a clinical trial by researchers from VU University Amsterdam.

"A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.

Phobias can be divided into specific phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Types of specific phobias include those to certain animals, natural environment situations, blood or injury, and specific situations. The most common are fear of spiders, fear of snakes, and fear of heights. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or situation. Social phobia is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them. Agoraphobia is when fear of a situation occurs because it is felt that escape would not be possible.

Specific phobias should be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves. Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with some combination of counselling and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.

Specific phobias affect about 6–8% of people in the Western world and 2–4% of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a given year. Social phobia affects about 7% of people in the United States and 0.5–2.5% of people in the rest of the world. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of people. Women are affected about twice as often as men. Typically onset is around the age of 10 to 17. Rates become lower as people get older. People with phobias are at a higher risk of suicide.","5,000+ downloads",,"Aug 30, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phobia.books

"What is ZeroPhobia Fear of Flying?

ZeroPhobia helps people to conquer their fear of flying. Developed by a team of psychologists and therapists from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, ZeroPhobia offers an evidence-based treatment program. All you need is your smartphone, a virtual reality viewer (e.g., Google Cardboard), some time, and a little dedication. Our goal is to make evidence-based treatment simple, accessible, and affordable.

What you will get

ZeroPhobia is a complete treatment program to help you overcome your fear of flying. Six modules provide you with information about the nature of your fear, relaxation exercises, setting goals, getting through difficult moments, tackling negative thoughts, and practicing with challenging situations. Besides the modules, seven virtual reality levels allow you to practice with handling your fear during check-in, waiting for your flight, take off, turbulence, and landing. Tara, ZeroPhobia’s virtual therapist, guides you through every step of the way.

For whom?

ZeroPhobia is intended for anyone who suffers from fear of flying and wants to do something about it. You can follow ZeroPhobia by yourself, in your own time, and from the comfort of your own home.

Research and scientific background

ZeroPhobia is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This type of therapy is very effective in treating fears, like fear of flying. The effectiveness of ZeroPhobia has been tested by a team of researchers from VU University Amsterdam. In total, 153 people suffering from fear of flying recently participated in this randomized controlled trial.

Ghost Hunters Horror Game plunges you into a world of paranormal activities, where you take on the role of a ghost hunter investigating a haunted house once inhabited by a 97-year-old psychopath. During his life, he kidnapped and tortured dozens of people. Rumors say that evil spirits still haunt this place, feeding on the fear of the living. As you explore the house, you must use your skills and tools to survive the terrifying encounters that await you.

Mission:

Your mission is to uncover the dark secrets of the haunted house. Armed with an EMF radar, you must locate the ghost, gather evidence, and identify its type. Capture the ghost on camera to prove its existence and escape the house alive. The more evidence you gather, the closer you come to understanding the horrors that took place within these walls.

Tasks in Ghost Hunters Horror Game:

Enter the psychopath's house and begin your investigation.
Use the EMF radar to locate the ghost.
Collect evidence to determine the ghost’s type.
Take a picture of the ghost to confirm its presence.

Each task challenges your ability to remain calm under pressure, as the supernatural presence tests your nerves. The more evidence you collect, the more the ghost will try to evade you, making it crucial to act quickly and decisively.

Ghosts:

Phantom: A dangerous ghost known for its ability to fly and pass through walls. The Phantom almost never touches the ground, making it difficult to track by footsteps. However, it is highly sensitive to Smudging, which can weaken its power and drive it away temporarily.

Shade: Also known as a ""noisy ghost,"" the Shade can manipulate objects to spread fear. It can throw multiple objects simultaneously, creating a chaotic environment. Despite its power, the Shade is nearly ineffective in an empty room, where it lacks objects to manipulate.

Banshee: A territorial ghost that attacks when provoked, moving at incredible speeds when its target is far away. Disabling the location’s power source can neutralize its speed, providing you with a crucial opportunity to escape or gather evidence.

Demon: The most dangerous ghost, known to attack without reason. Demons have no weaknesses and attack more frequently than other ghosts, making them a relentless threat. Encountering a Demon means you must be prepared for a continuous assault with little time to react.

Multiplayer Mode:
Ghost Hunters Horror Game features a multiplayer mode where you and your friends can team up to face the horrors together. Whether you're cooperating to uncover the secrets of the haunted house or competing to gather the most evidence, the multiplayer experience is intense and thrilling. The game’s dynamics change dramatically when playing with others, as you must coordinate your efforts to outsmart and outmaneuver the ghosts. Use tools like the EMF radar and ghost detector apps to track down the spirits, and communicate constantly to avoid falling into the deadly traps set by the ghosts.
Survival Tips:
Survival in Ghost Hunters Horror Game requires more than just bravery; The EMF radar is indispensable for tracking ghosts, but not all ghosts respond the same way.

Identifying the type of ghost quickly is crucial. Each ghost has its own strengths and weaknesses, and knowing them can give you the upper hand.
Stay close to your teammates in multiplayer mode.

While inspired by many paranormal investigation experiences, game offers a unique take on ghost hunting and supernatural encounters. Fans of the horror genre may find similarities in atmosphere to games like Phasmophobia, but this is an entirely original creation with its own distinctive features and mechanics.

"Everybody has some fears and worries – as humans, we’re programmed to feel fear as a natural response to threats in order to protect and look after ourselves.

But, what happens when your fears begin to take over? Fear can control your life and keep you from following your dreams, prevent you from taking risks, and stop you from living the life that you want and doing the things.


Our app covers several essential categories which take care of your needs. We provide a pre-defined checklist and also allow you to customize features according to your needs and requirements.

If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted.

It is impossible for you to get from life what you really desire when you aren't willing to do what it takes to know how to overcome fear of being successful. There are times that you think you are almost touching happiness and holding it tightly, but you can't be sure enough how to overcome fear. When this kind of fear is strong, some sort of negative feeling is coming your way that doesn't allow you to let go things which would be able to accelerate your path to success.

The fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there.

Break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous.","1,000+ downloads",,"Oct 9, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhadbadati.apps.overcome_fear

"When positive affirmations become a habit, watch your life change. With Enchant, unlock the power of your subconscious mind through affirmation and hypnosis. Create a headspace where you are focused, calm, and have the motivation to reach your goals.

Use affirmation and hypnosis together to better help your mental and physical well-being.

Reprogram Your Mind for Success

Daily affirmations are a form of mental training. Your brain is constantly forming new connections, and each daily affirmation strengthens the neural pathways associated with those positive thoughts. Using simple repetition, you can reinforce a positive attitude, affirm your self-belief, and empower yourself to take positive action toward the life you want to live.

How the Right Affirmation Can Change Your Life

Do you struggle with…
- Negative self-talk? You’re not alone if you feel like you're not good enough or doubt your abilities. Take care of your mental health by transforming negative thoughts and creating better headspace with positive ones.
- Stress and anxiety? Stress and overwhelm can take a toll on your mental and physical health. Promote feelings of calm with a daily affirmation.
- Limiting beliefs? Negative beliefs about yourself or the world hold you back. Affirmations can help you change them and open yourself up to new possibilities.
- A lack of confidence? If you struggle to believe in yourself or take on new challenges, empower your confidence and boost your self-esteem with positive affirmations.
- Achieving your goals? Do you set goals but then struggle to follow through? Affirm your motivation, elevate your habits, and focus on what you want to achieve.
- Feeling stuck in a rut? If you feel like your life is going nowhere, positive affirmations can help you shift your mindset and create the change you want to see.

A Pathway to Better Help
Enchant’s hypnosis tracks guide you into deep relaxation with calming music and soothing voices. Here, your mind becomes more open to suggestions so you can plant the seed for change into your subconscious.

Improved Health and Well-Being

Hypnosis can help you overcome:
😴 Sleep problems: If you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, hypnosis can be a natural approach to improving sleep quality. It can help quiet your mind, promote relaxation, and establish better sleep patterns.
💥 Chronic pain: Hypnosis can be a helpful tool for managing pain, especially chronic pain. It can help reduce the perception of pain and allow for better relaxation, which can indirectly improve pain tolerance.
⛔️ Unwanted habits: Hypnosis can be used to address unwanted habits like smoking, nail-biting, or overeating. It can help you identify the underlying triggers for the habit and create positive change in your subconscious mind.
😰 Phobias: Hypnosis can be a powerful tool for reducing fears and phobias. It can empower you to confront them in a safe, controlled setting.
😫 Stress & anxiety: Feeling overwhelmed or constantly stressed can take a toll on your well-being. Hypnosis can help you achieve a deeper state of relaxation, improve your focus, and develop healthy coping mechanisms to improve your mental health.
🤸‍♂️ Plus! Athletes, musicians, and others use hypnosis to enhance their performance — improving their focus, concentration, and motivation. Use it to visualize your success and access a state of peak performance.

Hypnosis plants a seed deep in your mind, and daily affirmations nurture it so it grows strong. By combining the power of hypnosis with the reinforcement of daily affirmations, you create a sustainable strategy for positive change and personal growth.

"Learn Spanish, Korean and Japanese language by speaking from the start!


Practice speaking essential expressions in first-person POV scenarios.



👀 ""But I can just learn it by watching Netflix!?”


Just like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS, Japanese by watching anime or Spanish by eating tacos! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop, watching anime and eating tacos. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK, you have to, well – SPEAK! TEUIDA's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.



⏳ 3 min > 30 min


We believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speaks.


Why waste your precious time learning about languages when you can learn by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.



😏 Overcome fear of speaking

Research shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? TEUIDA helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)



Here’s a list of things that make TEUIDA different:


🎯 Essential expressions

No more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no one actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say ""I am a boy, you are a woman"" in real-life?)



🎯 Effective curriculum


Once you master our curriculum, you will be able to know the basic vocabularies, grammars and of course, speak to your friends in Korean and Japanese.



🎯 Taught by Bilingual Tutors


Our crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak your target language but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!



🎯 AI Pronunciation Analysis


What's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? TEUIDA has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.



🎯 Fun, Interactive Stories


We believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.



🎯 Real-life Scenarios


Real-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to asking for directions!



🎯 Culture-specific tips


A wise man once said that ""the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool"". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of each country.





So... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with TEUIDA!



===========


Please note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features.
We only use the microphone's voice recognition in to evaluate your pronunciation.

"The Self-Compassion App is for you if you want to feel happier, calmer & more connected. Whether you get caught up in cycles of stress and anxiety, regularly give yourself a hard time or struggle to relax and enjoy the moment – this app can help.

The app includes scientifically-validated practices from Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), with 50+ tools to help you when life gets hard. Be guided by Drs Chris Irons and Elaine Beaumont – leading authorities on self-compassion, who collectively have 40+ years of experience as therapists and have helped tens of thousands of people.

This app has undergone a nationwide study, with participants showing significant reductions in stress, anxiety, self criticism, and increases in wellbeing. Anyone can develop self-compassion and enjoy all its benefits – we look forward to showing you how.

Why self-compassion?
We are often our own harshest critic, talking to ourselves in ways that we would never do our close friends. Given that we spend more time with ourselves than anyone else, isn’t it strange that many of us don’t treat ourselves with the same level of kindness, care and support as we do our close friends? Now is your time to start.

With evidence based ideas and exercises from CFT, this app will teach you how to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Through the course, you’ll learn how to strike a balance between self improvement & self acceptance: teaching you how to have a realistic but kind view of difficulties that arise in life, and giving you the confidence you need to achieve your goals in life, work and relationships.
A toolkit for managing the ups and downs of life.

Reduce anxiety, stress & depression
Improve mood & wellbeing
Reduce feelings of shame & low self-esteem
Better understand yourself
Increase your confidence
Improve your productivity
Appreciate the good in every day
Develop your relationships
Feel calm & grounded
Be kinder to yourself
And more...

There’s something for everyone:
Visual breathing tools to bring you back to the present
Sleep stories & meditations
HIIT and yoga videos to get you moving
Mindfulness audio guides
Cutting-edge tools to measure & improve your heart rate variability
Journaling to create habits of positivity
Step-by-step reflective exercises to help you manage difficult emotions

And more!

About Chris Irons & Elaine Beaumont

We’re so excited to see you all loving the app – we’re passionate about the benefits of self-compassion
and feel very lucky to be able to share the joys of it with others.

We know therapy isn’t an option for everyone – our mission is to create an app that is more effective than a book, and more accessible than therapy.

*DISCLAIMER-IMPORTANT*
The app is still in beta and works great with some charts but will not work with others. Backstitches and fractional stitches are not supported. Scans and images can be used but only with limited functionality.

The app is tested with charts from Paine Free Crafts, Tilton Crafts, Heaven and Earth Designs, Artecy, Charting Creations, Golden Kite, Cross Stitch 4 Everyone, Orenco Originals, Advanced Cross Stitch, and The Cross Stitch Studio.

View your chart as one continuous pattern. Easily stitch over page breaks.

Highlight symbols to see where to stitch. When highlighting, the thread number of that symbol is shown. There is no need to flip back and forth between the chart and the legend.

Mark finished stitches. Select easily by swiping horizontally, vertically, or even on the diagonal. It is also possible to mark an entire 10 by 10 square. If you import a chart that already has annotations in it, we try to import that as your current progress. Finished stitches are displayed in color, making it easy to navigate and compare with your stitching.

"Remember that trauma processing is really hard, and even though it may feel like your life has been upended, your symptoms are inherently temporary. With the right strategies and techniques, PTSD can be beaten, which has been proven by decades of research and the Trauma Brace founder’s personal experience overcoming trauma. Hopefully, Brace can teach you how to heal. Just like with traditional therapy, the exercises can be tough, but the more you put in, the more you can get out!

** What is Brace? **
Brace is a full, end-to-end program for people who are struggling after a trauma. You do not need to have a therapist to use Brace, and you do not need to have an official PTSD diagnosis. Regardless of your trauma type, or whether you are a soldier or civilian, Brace was designed with you in mind.
It is based on techniques that have been studied for decades and are proven to help reduce symptoms after a trauma. Brace makes these techniques available in a self-help format by providing instructions, help and tracking as you progress through the exercises and make your way to graduation, which typically takes about 5 sessions per week for 9-12 weeks. In a clinical setting, the majority of PTSD patients who follow these same steps see a significant reduction in symptoms.

Brace was developed by a PTSD survivor who wanted to make this knowledge more accessible and affordable for other sufferers. This type of therapy typically costs $7,000+ but full access to Brace is less than 1% of that. Brace will start with an assessment that can help you understand how severe your symptoms are and whether or not the full program might be a good fit. Only once you see your score and complete the free introduction will you be asked to decide if you’d like to pay to continue with the full program.

** Who is it for? **
Brace is for anyone struggling after experiencing something traumatic. Some examples are:
- Combat
- Assault
- Terrorism
- Severe accident
- Loss of loved one
- Abuse
- Life-threatening illness
- Healthcare maltreatment
- Natural disasters
…and more

If after the trauma you’ve been experiencing some of the following symptoms, you might need help processing what happened:
- Nightmares
- Insomnia
- Flashbacks
- Panic attacks
- Physiological response (high heart rate, heavy breathing)
- Hyper-vigilance, or feeling super alert
- Irritability or outbursts
- Feeling cut off from people or activities you used to love
- Difficulty concentrating
- Lack of intimacy
- Feeling detached or unable to experience positive emotion
- Overwhelming guilt or shame
- Self-destructive behaviors
…and more

"Microscopy identification is still regarded as the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of human parasitic diseases.

Due to the above reason, this app is created to facilitate the learners to be familiarised with the key microscopic characteristics of human parasites as observed in various specimens, including faecal material, blood, body fluid or tissue.

The author has included a total of 80 microscopic images of the common human parasites. These parasites are divided into 2 clusters, namely protozoa and helminth; each is further sub-divided into 3 groups which are the gastrointestinal, blood & body fluid and tissues specimen.

Two different modes can be utilised by the learners, depending on their learning needs, either the study mode or the random mode. In the study mode, the learners can learn by going through the properly-structured flow of images and answers, in which the answers have included the scientific and common name of the parasite, and the description of the key morphology characteristic. The learners can also attempt the random mode, in which an image will be randomly shown to knowledge check purpose.","10,000+ downloads",,"Aug 28, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plumpturtlecreativestudio.parasitology_flashcard

"The NSW Trauma App will ensure clinicians are supported in the care of the trauma patient and are able to manage to meet the needs of the specific traumatically injured patient. Clinicians in metropolitan, rural and remote areas require standardised, easy access to clinical support tools and up-to-date, evidence-based information to deliver optimal care. This includes the provision of trauma resources for pre-hospital and intra-hospital clinicians. All clinicians require portable and versatile amenity in trauma care that can be utilised on a smart phone or tablet operable in environments such as poor cellular or WiFi access locations.

This app is developed for all medical, nursing and allied health clinicians of NSW Health and NSW Ambulance working across the trauma continuum within the state. The NSW Trauma App provides:

• Localised guideline repository:
The Guideline repository has been provided from bodies within NSW Health including Ambulance Service of NSW (ASNSW), Local Health Districts and trauma services. The guidelines and information, sourced from public domains, are referenced and acknowledged within the app.

• Specific burn injury resources:
The Institute of Trauma and Injury Management has worked with the NSW Burn Injury Network to provide Trauma resources specific to burns injuries including guidelines, checklists and additional resources.

• Interactive Burns Calculator:
The calculator enables automatic determination of the total body surface area (TBSA) of burn injury by allowing the user to mark the area of burn injury on a body chart. Additionally entering a weight, time since burn and fluid already administered allows automatic calculation of the fluid requirement for the first eight hours since the time of injury and the following 16 hours, expected urine output and maintenance fluids required.

• Detailed NSW health facility information:
Provides information such as site specific details, resource availability and contact information of more than 200 facilities. This enables onsite and remote clinicians to provide location specific advice, enabling the patient to receive timely treatment and progress through the trauma system, reducing unwarranted clinical variation.

• Trauma related medical calculators, Interactive checklists and Clinical timestamps

User evaluations show that the NSW Trauma App has resulted in improving access to user friendly trauma resources informing adult and paediatric care givers; including guidelines and facility information, educational material and updated evidence-based practice.

Benefits of the app relate to patients, clinicians and the trauma system through access to appropriate and timely evidence-cased trauma care, improved patient experience, easy access to clinical support tools and improved standardisation of care.","10,000+ downloads",,"Nov 1, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aci.itim.trauma

"The N-Back Challenge provides a special type of cognitive training, “dual n-back,” that helps you raise your IQ in just a few minutes per day. Sounds implausible? The N-Back Challenge is based on a decade’s worth of scientific studies, published in top peer-reviewed journals, including Nature. (For more details, see https://nbackchallenge.com/science.)

The catch? It’s no fun at all! Indeed, the training is designed to be maximally exhausting. If you are determined enough to make it through 20 sessions, however, science suggests that you stand to reap powerful benefits.

Intelligence is the ultimate cognitive ability: You need it to learn, reason, solve novel problems, and see connections. Higher IQs have been linked to improved academic achievement, professional success, and even better health. Since it will take you just 7 hours, in total, to complete the N-Back Challenge, not much more than the length of a single school day, it may prove to be the best investment of time you’ve ever made!

------------------------------

SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND: Not only has the dual n-back paradigm been validated in top peer-reviewed journals, but our two founders – both PhDs, one with a focus on neuroscience, the other with a focus on higher education – have taken particular care to thoroughly align the app with the prevailing scientific research.

TRACK YOUR PROGRESS: In order to help you stay motivated, the N-Back Challenge allows you to visually monitor your progress over time, build up “streaks,” and compare yourself against other learners across various stats.

COMPETE AGAINST YOUR FRIENDS: Perhaps the most powerful way of making sure you remain motivated to complete the Challenge is to tackle it together with friends or colleagues. To make it more fun, we’ve provided leaderboards that allow you to compete based on who has completed the most sessions, racked up the longest streak, and more.

CUSTOMIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE: The N-Back Challenge allows you to choose between different voices across multiple languages, turn on notifications, and customize their timing and style. There are advanced settings for turning on instant button feedback, controlling the n-back level, and tweaking the game speed. And if you are too busy to complete one session every day, you may switch to the Weekly Habit, which gives you a full week to complete each session.

------------------------------

ARE YOU…

… A PARENT? Give your children an edge at school or university by nudging them to complete the N-Back Challenge. Indeed, why not tackle the Challenge together as a family?

… A GRANDCHILD? Help your grandparents (and other older relatives) fight cognitive decline by introducing them to dual n-back. (See https://nbackchallenge.com/decline.)

… A KNOWLEDGE WORKER? Share the N-Back Challenge with your HR department. Dual n-back may well be the single most cost-effective way of making knowledge workers more productive. (See https://nbackchallenge.com/work.)

… A TEACHER? Use dual n-back to enhance students' problem-solving skills. You can have a big impact, with a minimal investment of time! (See https://nbackchallenge.com/class.)

------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS: The N-Back Challenge is free as long as you stick to the program. When you miss or delay a session, we ask you to support us with a “coffee,” which you can buy in-app or earn — for example, by using the Share link in the Settings to invite friends. (Each of you will receive a free coffee.) You can also unlock unlimited free breaks by becoming a premium subscriber.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT: Do you have any questions or suggestions? Like to say hello? We’re happy to hear from you! Just drop us a note at support@nbackchallenge.com.

"Functioning:

This app facilitates an optimal load of the human brain by displaying a moving object in combination with playing a sound effect. The goal of this is to support the desensitization process step, one of the key components part of the EMDR process.

For the benefit of user convenience, various preferences can be set inside the app with regard to the movement pattern, the color and size of the ball, the background color and the sound effect to be played. It is also possible for some settings to choose for the 'random' option and there are several settings for so-called 'surprise effects'.

Because of the simple user interface of the app, it is also very suitable for children. Furthermore a number of sound effects, as well as the surprise effect of suddenly appearing pictures, will have a positive effect on the imagination of the young user.

Background:

This app is realized in close cooperation with a professional operating in the domain of the mental health care.

The functionality of the app is based on the principle of the much discussed EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) used for trauma processing under the supervision of a professional. The developers of this app therefore advice to only use this app to support therapy by a certified practitioner.

Besides the treatment of trauma the working area of EMDR is expanding strongly. For example experiments have been started with compulsive behavior, persistent cravings and overpowering itch.
Since the aspect of self practice with these kind of complaints is already a standardized part of the treatment, it is our expectation that a self-help app like this will obtain a reasonable amount of applicability exactly in this area.

This app is offered for the once only symbolic amount of 1 Euro excl. VAT. The revenue will be used for the purpose of (free) updates to adjust the app even better to the needs of the user based on the received feedback.

Usage:

When you start the app, the menu screen is shown. In the top of this screen you can see the menu bar with the options menu, a control panel in the bottom of the screen and a small status bar in the top left. In the status bar you can see the pattern you have selected, the sound effect you have chosen and the current motion speed.

In the control panel buttons are present to start and stop the movement of the ball. In this panel you can also control the speed and a button is present to activate the full-screen mode. From the full-screen mode it is possible to return to the menu screen by touching the screen in an arbitrary position.

Besides English, this app also supports the languages Spanish, French, German and Dutch.",4.2 and up,RMsoft,2.16d,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rmsoft.myemdr

Beneficiaries and providers use the app individually, or together during a patient encounter, to determine whether the VA will pay for care delivery.The VFMP - CHAMPVA app uses several different medical code sets to determine if services and/or equipment are covered.  Over 487,000 individual medical codes are listed in the included databases.  Medical code sets include:American Dental Association (ADA) codes, which describe dental services.  ADA coding identifies services rendered.Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, which describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services.  CPT coding identifies services rendered.ICD-10 codes, which relate to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).  It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.  The CHAMPVA app uses ICD-10-CM data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, which provide a standardized coding system for describing the specific items and services provided in the delivery of health care. Such coding is necessary for CHAMPVA, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance programs to ensure that insurance claims are processed in an orderly and consistent manner.Durable Medical Equipment (DME) codes refer to equipment that can withstand repeated use, is primarily used to serve a medical purpose, is generally not useful in the absence of an illness or injury and is appropriate for use in the home.   DME codes are included with HCPCS Codes.The national drug codes (NDC) are unique 10-digit, three segment numerical codes that identify drugs intended for human use. The first segment is a 4 to 5 digit, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigned labeler code to identify the firm that manufactures or distributes a drug.   The second segment is the product code, which identifies the drug, including the specific strength, dosage form, and formulation. The third segment, the package code, identifies package sizes and types.For billing purposes an 11-digit 5-4-2 format code is used based on the NDC code.  The CHAMPVA app uses the information published by the FDA and converts the NDC code to the billing code.Medical codes are searchable via the alphanumeric code, name or description.Once a desired medical code is identified, a patient or provider may select it to determine if it is Covered by CHAMPVA.  Results DO NOT constitute an authorization by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for any purchase.The CHAMPVA program guide is included that provides a more detailed explanation of CHAMPVA benefits. The CHAMPVA Guide contains links to applicable websites as well as phone numbers that can be called from your phone by tapping on the number.

With ICE App, the first time responders will easily have access to all the information they will need to provide you with medical emergency help and also to call your loved ones. The app also includes a ‘secret’ section which will be encrypted with a passcode so that only a loved one who has the passcode may have access to the information inside it. The screen will display a message directing the responders to contact the person with the passcode. Other details like your vaccine history, physician contact and insurance may also be stored in the app and may come in handy when receiving medical emergency help.


How will responders access the information?
The responders will be redirected to the emergency medical ID or information stored in the app when they tap the notification bar on the lock screen of your phone.

How to show Notification/Floating icon over locked screen?
Under More tab, you will see Notification / Lock Screen feature and clicking on that you can enable or disable the each feature from lock screen. You must provide some permission to allow this. Notification is by default.

How can the premium version be unlocked?
Go to the ‘More’ tab on ICE Emergency app and tap ‘upgrade to premium’. You will just need to pay USD $8 to receive access to unlimited features on the ICE - In Case of Emergency.

What does the premium version offer?
Among the unlimited features that you have access to with the premium version of ICE Emergency app, here are the most notable ones:
● You can store a 30-second voice recording which will appear on the profile page. This feature will be an additional asset if you were in need of medical emergency help.
● By clicking on the ‘App lock’ option, you can enable or disable the app lock. This will restrict the user from editing the information unless he or she has the pin or provides fingerprint verification.
● You can also back up the medical contact card from the ICE Emergency app into your computer or on Google drive. The information may also be restored onto the Medical ID ICE App from these locations.

Accessibility Service
One of the primary features of the app is the ability to view and access your medical information from your lock screen, which is facilitated via an accessibility service that you can activate. The accessibility service adds a widget to your lock screen after it's turned on. In an emergency, this widget assists people with impairments or first responders in taking action and accessing medical data.

Keeping yourself fully prepared for an emergency situation or accidents never hurts. The sooner you have your digital medical contact card ready, the better. So what are you waiting for? It will barely take a minute to find ICE - In case of emergency App on play store and install it on your phone.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy does not exist as a distinct therapeutic technique. The term ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" is a very general term for a classification of therapies with similarities. There are several approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy, including Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy.
 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an approach used by psychotherapists to influence a patient's behaviors and emotions. The key to the approach is in its procedure which must be systematic. It has been used successfully to treat a variety of disorders including eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, and personality disorders. It can be used in individual or group therapy sessions and the approach can also be geared towards self-help therapy.  
 
The effectiveness of the treatment can clearly be judged based on its results. The more it is used, the more it has become recommended. It is now used as the number one treatment technique for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and bulimia.
 
CBT is effective for a variety of conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, addiction, dependence, tic, and psychotic disorders.

What is an IQ Test?
---------------------------------------------------------------

An IQ test is used to show how ""intelligent"" you are in relation to other people. But what is intelligence? This is not a defined term and so intelligence is just what an IQ test measures. Therefore, different IQ tests can not be compared, just the same test, and it simply tells you if you have solved the tasks better (over IQ 100) or worse (under IQ 100) than the average. So do not take the IQ that seriously, just test how you cut off compared to others! This app is also developed for brain training.

"Numbers communicate so much, yet they are often left out of communication therapy. Now stroke survivors can practice understanding, saying, and typing numbers at home to improve these essential life skills.

Age, dates, phone numbers, addresses, money, time, measurements, fractions, weight, years – numbers are everywhere and so important. Be more independent with communication with stronger number communication skills.

Would you be able to understand, write down, and tell someone this phone message?

“Your appointment is at 3:15 p.m. on August 3rd, 2015 at 1650 18th Avenue. Bring $5. Please call back to confirm at 785-5662.”

Work on all these number skills and more with the evidence-based Number Therapy app!

Number Therapy Lite gives you a free way to test-drive the full functionality of the app with a sample from the 30 categories of numbers including:
*Single Digits
*Double Digits
*Triple Digits
*Four Digits
*Time
*Money
*Phone Numbers (add your own in the full version)
*Ordinals
*Fractions

Number Therapy offers thousands of unique exercises you can use anywhere. Number Therapy Lite gives you a taste so you'll know the app is worth using. Work at your own pace to practice the skills that matter to you.

This app has the same highly customizable, clean, intuitive interface you’ve come to love in Tactus Therapy apps. Developed in conjunction with people with aphasia, this app is designed to help you get the intensity of practice you need in a way that is easy to use.

Number Therapy also gives you recommendations for which level and settings you should use based on your score. See how easy it is to make progress when you're working at the right level for you!

Speech-Language Pathologists: use Number Therapy to make the communication of numbers a part of your therapy plan for people with aphasia or other disorders. Three unique activities address auditory and reading comprehension, verbal expression, and written expression. Your clients can use the built-in hints, cues, and audio recording to be successful, then e-mail you their results in a professional report so you can track their progress over time.

Ideal for use in the clinic and at home, add Number Therapy to your therapy app collection!


Number Therapy Lite is a FREE trial version of Number Therapy.

What's the difference?

Lite = 4 categories with 7 items in each; Full = 30 categories with thousands of items
Lite = categories contain a mix of items from subcategories; Full = focus on just one subcategory at a time or mix & match
Lite = no custom phone numbers; Full = unlimited custom phone numbers
Lite = 7 exercises at a time; Full = 10, 25, 50, or 100 in a session

Once you've given it a try, you'll want to get the full version so you can truly master the communication of numbers and be more independent.

*Please note: this app does NOT address math skills or equations. It focuses on the communication of numbers, not calculations.

Hello, I am the father of a girl with autism. This application was made by me to help other parents of children with ASD and professionals dealing with autistic children.
The application is based on the ATEC test from the American Autism Research Institute. It is designed for children from 5 to 12 years.

But you can pass the test for children 3-4 years old before visiting a doctor and getting an official diagnosis to dispel or confirm your fears.
---
If a child is younger than 3 years old, the test is strictly irrelevant.
For children from one and a half to three years, use the quick test M-CHAT-R: https://www.autismspeaks.org/screen-your-child
---
How does the test work?

The test is used to assess the dynamics of improvements in children with autism or also for initial testing of children who may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Basically, the lower the score, the fewer the problems.

Thus, if a person scores a '20' on one day, and then a '15' two weeks later, then the individual showed improvement. In contrast, if the score was '30', then the individual's behavior worsened.

For more correct scores, it is better if different people in contact with the child take the test. For example, if on the same day dad, mom, and specialist in the rehabilitation center give different answers, you will get a different number of points. The application will calculate the average score on that day and show it on the chart.
---
Warning!
The ATEC test is not a medical diagnostic test!
The application is not intended to set the diagnosis. It basically provides several subscale scores as well as a total score to be used for comparison at a later date.

If you have scored more than 30 points, you should contact a specialist to make a survey and precise diagnosis.","100,000+ downloads",,"Aug 26, 2024",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.atec

"Uniquely designed for sufferers of stress-related insomnia, this app harnesses the power of bilateral stimulation (bls) and soothing words and music, to turn off tension and worry and restore normal sleep functioning. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR therapy, a psychological treatment method which harnesses your brains ability to process sensory information to de-activate the physical and mental distress which inhibits sleep. The resulting normalization of brain activity creates the conditions for sleep to happen, naturally and effortlessly. If you suffer from insomnia related to PTSD, medical problems or just general stress and anxiety this app is for you. This app works best with a good internet connection and a set of headphones.

"Turn speech therapy practice into a fun and engaging game with Score 4 Articulation! Created by a speech-language pathologist, this innovative tool is perfect for achieving multiple trials of speech sounds, helping to improve speech skills. Whether you're a speech-language pathologist seeking an effective therapy tool or a parent looking for a fun way for your child to practice speech sounds at home, Score 4 Articulation is the perfect solution.

KEY FEATURES:

Engaging Gameplay: Enjoy the classic challenge of connecting four in a row, now with a twist! Each turn begins with practicing a speech sound, making articulation practice an integral part of the game.

Speech Mastery Through Play: During each turn, players can tap the word on the game piece to hear a pronunciation model before practicing it aloud. A visual counter tracks each repetition, encouraging the player to practice the word more frequently. This interactive approach motivates extensive practice, effectively refining the student's articulation skills.

Targeted Sound Practice: Choose from a variety of game boards, each focusing on different sounds including R (initial, vocalic, blends), S (initial, blends, final), L (initial, medial, blends), SH (initial, medial + final), CH (initial, final), J (initial, medial + final), and TH (voiceless). Target words have been meticulously selected by a speech-language pathologist, and a clear pronunciation model can be heard aloud by tapping on the image.

Multiple Modes and Levels: Challenge the computer in single-player mode or play against a friend, SLP, or parent in two-player mode. Select from easy to difficult levels to suit the student’s skill. If two students are practicing together in a group speech therapy session, they can each select a different target sound and play the game together, making group sessions more interactive and effective.

Rewards and Motivation: Achieve four in a row to win and celebrate by coloring in three stars! Additionally, the visual counter rewards every 10 repetitions with a star or diamond, motivating children to practice more and track their progress. These fun visual rewards encourage continued play and learning.

Research-Based Effectiveness: Research suggests that massed practice, with many repetitions in a short period, enhances speech sound acquisition and motor learning (Maas et al., 2008; Bislick et al., 2012). This game leverages this principle to help children improve their speech more effectively.

With Score 4 Articulation, speech practice is no longer a chore—it’s a game! Help your child or students master their speech sounds while having fun.

"Improve mental organization skills to help put your words back in order. Get unlimited practice with categories in one versatile speech therapy app.

When you struggle with categories due to stroke, brain injury, or autism, simple tasks like finding the right supermarket aisle or choosing a word can be impossible. But what if there was a way to heal these broken networks of meaning? To put the things in your brain back where they belong?

Get Category Therapy, an app designed for both speech-language pathologists and home users to help restructure the brain and let the ideas flow.

• Take control with evidence-based exercises designed by experts
• Improve word-finding and sorting skills with 4 engaging activities and unlimited practice
• Get an app that works in both home and clinical settings
• Interact with clear photos and a simple interface that's easy for everyone to use
• Adjust settings to target your goals and suit your needs
• Use e-mailed reports and customization to seamlessly fit the app into your therapy program

Download Category Therapy Lite for FREE to see how it can help!

When you lose the ability to group items and identify what they have in common, it gets in the way of your ability to understand, learn, and communicate. But with the right kind of practice, it’s possible to strengthen the connections between words and concepts and navigate your world more easily.

Get the right activity – for every brain.

No two people are the same. With 4 activities ranging from simple to complex, there's something in Category Therapy to match your needs. Work through them gradually or focus on the activity that best suits your needs.

1) Find: Start with the basics. You'll hear and see a photo of a category (let's say ""Fruit""). Tap the item that matches (for example, a banana).

2) Classify: Switch it up. Now you start with an item and choose the category that matches. This tests your ability to apply categories to what you see.

3) Exclude: Challenge yourself. By choosing an item that doesn't belong, you learn how to independently identify categories. As things get harder, you can always tap Hint for some help.

4) Add One: Train yourself to recognize common features of items – to categorize them – and then choose one item that fits the category you’ve identified.

When you're done, share your progress. The app makes it easy to quickly send detailed reports to a therapist or loved one.

Get every feature you need in one easy app.

• 70 categories and nearly 700 words in one package
• 3 difficulty levels ranging from simple objects to more abstract concepts
• Great for aphasia, brain injury, autism, and other cognitive & language impairments
• Switch to Pictures Only to practice naming or Words Only to practice reading
• Customize number of trials, choices, and more – it’s yours to control
• Designed with adults in mind but easy enough for children to use
• No subscriptions, no monthly bills, no Wi-Fi needed

There’s hope. With Category Therapy in your corner, you can build stronger connections between words – and learn to speak and think more easily.

"Do you want to help Elsa and work as a designer in our interior design games? Are you a makeover master and can build a house from scratch? Do you enjoy house design and merge games? If your answer is yes, then join Elsa on her journey and play Merge Hotel Empire house design games!

Her whole life, Elsa has been working as a salesperson while cherishing her dream to design, decorate, and open her very own hotel. She made her dream come true on her 30th birthday, when she finally left her job and bought a house in the suburbs to open a small hotel for families.

Elsa found her dream house in a very bad condition. It looks nothing like the photos! Soon enough Elsa realized that the manor she had purchased will require a lot more renovation that she had initially thought. The mansion was far from free and she was greatly deceived with the deal she was offered, but she took it anyway. Perhaps you can turn it into a beautiful designer building together with our heroine!

But the mansion games are not as simple as just decorating houses and taking care of the garden. There is another hotel in town, the owner of which is determined to eliminate all competition. To make it work, Elsa has to take up interior design and home design, renovate every single room, welcome guests and earn enough money to start her own hotel network. Are you up for the challenge?

Another plot twist that Elsa wasn’t ready for is the “curse of hoteliers” that hangs over the city for many years. Nobody’s decor skills have been able to lift it, so Elsa will be the next one to try. Only she can unravel the tangle of intrigues and bring the hotel to prosperity! Put your seatbelt on and prepare for a ride with our merge and home design games!

“My home needs help!”, Elsa thinks. Together, you can match and merge objects to create valuable tools that will help you. Merge Hotel Empire decorating games offer an opportunity to relax and submerge yourself in the exciting world of hospitality. If you enjoy design home and makeover games, you will definitely enjoy Merge Hotel Empire. Help make Elsa’s dream come true.

The mystery mansion is not as sweet and fun as it seems. There is some dark magic going on in the villa and you need to solve this puzzle. Flip the story upside down, escape your evil competitors, and decorate room after room in our decor game.

Encouraging your visual system to perform at its best is crucial.

While there are no effective eye exercises for refractive errors like astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia, certain eye exercises can optimize visual skills and address issues related to eye alignment and focusing. Vision therapy, a form of physical therapy for the eyes, involves prescribed exercises, including those for lazy eye, under the supervision of an eye doctor. While professional guidance is recommended, there are eye muscle exercises that can be practiced at home to improve focusing problems and alleviate eyestrain gradually. Although immediate results may not be expected, consistent practice can yield long-term benefits.","100,000+ downloads",Kingbrain,"Jul 19, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.divinememorygames.eyebooster

"Eye Exercises You Can Do at Home.

We know that exercising our muscles is good for our health. What about eye exercises to improve eyesight? Vision therapy, a type of physical therapy for the eyes, has been shown to improve certain conditions involving eye alignment and focusing.

Exercise for your eyes, traditionally in the form of vision therapy, can help to ensure that the two eyes work together effectively. There are common symptoms that may indicate that eye strengthening exercises may be useful. These include skipping lines or words while reading, closing an eye, eyestrain, and headache. Vision therapy can address problems with eye turn (strabismus) and lazy eye (amblyopia), eye tracking (saccadic dysfunction), and eye teaming (convergence insufficiency). Lazy eye exercises have been shown to be particularly helpful in correcting this condition, especially when it’s caught early.

Eye exercises are designed to strengthen your eye muscles, help you focus, ease eye movements, and stimulate your brain’s vision center. As you practice them and move on to new ones, you’ll learn how to control your eye muscles and see the way you should.

With a variety of eye exercises and vision therapy exercises to choose from, you can exercise your eye muscles and improve your vision in a way that suits your schedule and preferences. Eye yoga or eye workouts, this app offers a range of options to help you achieve healthy eyes and sharp vision.

Whether you're struggling with farsightedness, lazy eye or blurred vision, this app can help you overcome these eye problems through targeted eye training and eye therapy. Learn how to train your eyes, relax your eyes, and improve your eyesight with the easy-to-follow instructions and demonstrations provided in the app.

Eye exercises can be part of vision therapy. Think of it like physical therapy for your eyes.

Vision therapy is like rehabilitation therapy for a person’s eyes.

A doctor can prescribe vision therapy, which they will tailor to each person, to help improve visual skills and processing. Vision therapy may use both sensory- and movement-related activities.","100,000+ downloads",Khobta App,"Jan 30, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.khobta.eyeexercises

"Midmoon: Baby Sleep & Feeding is an app that helps moms create a daily schedule of their baby's sleep, nutrition, and activity. It offers a personal newborn breastfeeding tracker, an infant food diary, and a baby sleep timer, allowing you to track detailed statistics of your child's daily routine and receive timely notifications.

The app is beneficial for moms of newborn babies, moms of children under one-year-old, moms of children older than one year, as well as all parents, grandparents, nannies, and other caregivers responsible for the child.

In the application, you can find a baby sleep tracker, breastfeeding tracker, feeding tracker, baby activity log, timers and notifications, dark and light themes, and a user-friendly interface without unnecessary functions.

To use the app, you need to note all of your child's activities, including sleeping and feeding, complementary feeding by months, games, active and quiet waking, walks, etc. The app then calculates an individual, comfortable schedule just for your child, based on recommended norms and their personal needs.

The app also tells you when and why your baby might start to be cranky and when to start the bedtime routine, even if there are no visible signs of fatigue.

The Midmoon: Baby Sleep & Feeding app is convenient because it allows you to plan the day and anticipate your baby's desires before they get tired or start to cry.

Features of the app include a sleep tracker, child feeding (breastfeeding or artificial feeding), complementary foods by month (vegetables, fruit, cereals, meat, etc.), all kinds of activities (massage, walking, playing, bathing, etc.), and a baby development journal.

You can try the app for free for 7 days, and then choose the subscription period that is most comfortable for you. The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (week, month, half-year, year, or otherwise, depending on your chosen option). Canceling your subscription means auto-renewal will be turned off, but you will still have access to all app features for the remainder of your current period. Note that uninstalling the app does not cancel your subscriptions.

Featured on: TechCrunch, Wired, Esquire, The Telegraph, Tech Radar, Mac Observer

💡 Did you know?
Current keyboards are based on the 140-year-old mechanical typewriter layout (QWERTY). Typewise is different. It’s the first font app that is specifically designed for smartphones. It’s revolutionary yet easy to use, and after a couple of messages you’ll love it.

Typewise provides you with a wide range of keyboard background options, emojis, text fonts, and other features, such as auto paste keyboard and emoji keyboard that will make its use fun and easy. Change fonts to any font you want to maximize your fonts keyboard experience.

"With ""MAXI tip tap, my big interactive picture book"", create your landscape by typing words like TREE, HOUSE or SUNFLOWER. Add characters by writing NINO, JO, CHAT or CHIEN. You can then change the weather by typing RAIN, or make it fall NIGHT.

In ""tip tap on the road"", go on a trip and learn words in English! Type CAR or SAILING BOAT to reveal a means of transport. You can then change its color by typing BLUE or YELLOW. And even change its size by typing BIG or SMALL. The combinations are endless.

Book and screen combine to offer children an incredible initiation to words. Here, the book and the application are inseparable. The child types on his keyboard the letters of the word he has chosen in the picture book: the associated image appears instantly on the screen. It is up to our budding demiurge to complete and animate the scene by bringing to life the two hundred or so words of the book. Enlarging or reducing the elements, changing their color, making night fall, snow, speeding up or slowing down the speed of animals and vehicles, listening to words or a guitar tune... an infinite number of possibilities open up to the child to create wacky and fantastic universes, each time unique, while learning to write and read. With, as a bonus, a few little visual surprises ""hidden"" in the glossary of this very graphic work, which will delight all connoisseurs of the books of these talented artists (write ""helium"" for example). Once the scene is composed, it is always possible to save or print it.
An innovative application that combines creativity and learning, to put in all hands.

From 3 years.

"Psychology is the academic and applied study of mental functions and behaviors. The word ""psychology"" comes from two specific Greek words—psyche, which means ""soul,"" ""life,"" or ""mind,"" and logia, which means ""the study of."" Simply put, psychology is the study of the mind. The overarching goal of psychology is to understand the behavior, mental functions, and emotional processes of human beings. This field ultimately aims to benefit society, partly through its focus on better understanding of mental health and mental illness.

Most psychologists can be classified as social, behavioral, or cognitive scientists. Psychologists study many different areas, including biological foundations, mental well-being, change and development over time, the self and others, and potential dysfunctions. They explore how psychological factors interact with biological and sociocultural factors to influence individual development. Psychologists attempt to understand not only the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, but also the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.

ELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds† when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 3.99% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 1 to 10 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender's terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.

PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 3.99% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $339 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,253 to $28,492.

† Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the personal loan, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's ""ability to pay standard"" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.","50,000,000+ downloads","Credit Karma, LLC","Jul 17, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creditkarma.mobile

"Is losing weight harder than it should be for you?

Do you find yourself losing weight then putting it back on again, again and again?

The problem with diets and short-term weight loss solutions is that, by definition, they're a change from the norm. Then, when you go back to 'normal life', the weight comes back on again.

A permanently healthy weight needs a permanently healthy mindset, which means a change in the way you relate to food. And this is where hypnosis comes in.

The free hypnosis session in the Weight Loss Hypnosis app from Uncommon Knowledge will firstly, relax you wonderfully deeply. Then it will work with your unconscious mind to change your attitude to food so that you start to desire what's good for you, instead of craving what's not.

With over 20 years experience, and more than 750,000 hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to get your unconscious mind on your side.

The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session. You can use that for as long as you like, but if you want more variety at any time you can upgrade to the monthly paid option and access 10 more weight loss sessions.

Our most popular weight loss session 'Healthy Eating' is free inside the app to get your new approach to weight loss started right away. Then, if you like what you hear, you can unlock the other sessions with the monthly payment option.


From Uncommon Knowledge, delivering hypnosis since 1998.

"Use hypnosis to harness your own inner strengths and create changes in your mind and body within minutes. Reprogram your mind, transform how you feel and like your life.

Doddle self-hypnosis sessions will help you achieve a deep state of focused relaxation and creativity so that you can finally make the changes you want to see in your life. With guided hypnosis sessions ranging from 90 seconds to 30 minutes, you can easily start to shift your mood, adopt new habits, and feel more calm and confident each day.

Try Doddle free for 7 days!

While traditional meditation and “positive thinking” are very conscious actions (and can often feel challenging), hypnosis makes it easy to quiet your inner critic and communicate directly with your subconscious mind to change your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors based on your goals.

Doddle includes powerful self-hypnosis sessions for…
- Fast stress relief: our “mood shifters” library includes dozens of recordings that are less than 5 minutes, designed to help you quickly shift your mood and get out of a stress response quickly
- Hypnosis on-the-go: our eyes-open hypnosis libraries allow you to reprogram your mind while walking, showering, and when you’re out and about
- Joy, happiness, & confidence
- Relaxation
- Stress & anxiety relief
- Connecting with your goals & future self
- Focus & motivation
- Habits
- Morning
- Evening
- Sleep
- Health & healing to support your physical wellbeing

NOTE: Hypnosis is nothing like what you see in the movies. In fact, self hypnosis feels a lot like a wonderful, relaxing, guided meditation, and you are in control the entire time. However, unlike meditation, every hypnosis session has a specific goal to create a change in your life.

Quick facts about hypnosis:
- Hypnosis is highly researched and supported by psychology and neuroscience, and is one of the fastest and most effective ways to transform one’s mental and physical wellbeing
- Hypnosis feels like a deeply relaxing guided meditation intended for a specific outcome
- Hypnosis is entirely safe, and you are fully in control the whole time (you are fully aware, and you can open your eyes at any time)
- You will only take in suggestions that you want to accept
- Hypnosis is not the same as sleep. You are awake and aware the entire time (except for in our Doddle Sleep Series, which is designed to help you fall asleep)
- Hypnosis allows you to communicate with your subconscious mind by focusing your attention and relaxing your mind and body. The subconscious mind is responsible for 95% of our brain function, including our emotions, habits, behaviors, beliefs, and so much more
- Anyone can be hypnotized, and self-hypnosis and visualization are skills that can be strengthened with practice

💬 I can testify to the real effectiveness of the Ericksonian hypnosis and self-hypnosis sessions via Opensynaps. Before starting the sessions, I suffered from post-traumatic stress for 4 years that no medical treatment could cure, and since following your stress reduction program, I have regained my life, even better than before. It’s a true rebirth. - Pierre

💬 I tried other energy techniques including EFT, which worked. However, Opensynaps is more effective; I feel more relaxed, joy has returned to my life, and I approach situations more calmly and serenely. I used to be quite reactive, and the perspective I now take is very powerful in my life. I am also very sensitive to the aesthetic side, which I find very successful. As I am very visual, I think this enhances the effect of hypnosis. - Mylène

💬 Thank you very much for this self-hypnosis app, I love the support it offers. It helps me quit smoking. I’m only on my 3rd day of quitting with a 21 mg patch and 2.5 mg lozenge. - Cindy

📈 +30% positive progress in less than 40 days
A study followed 90 users for 40 days on Opensynaps. Daily psychological feelings were collected on four values: happiness, calm, well-being, and energy. From the first day of connection to the fortieth day of use, it was found that after 40 days following Opensynaps programs, the perception of the 4 measured values had increased by 30% to 40%.

🛡️ Enjoy peace of mind with total security and confidentiality

Learning how to do hypnosis for sleep has many potential benefits. It can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as improve the overall quality of sleep. Through relaxation and visualization, hypnosis can help to relax the body and mind, making it easier to drift off to sleep. It can also help to quiet the mind and reduce intrusive thoughts, making it easier to stay asleep.


You can also use hypnosis for stopping smoking. During a hypnosis session for smoking cessation, the hypnotist will typically use relaxation and visualization techniques to help the person relax and focus.

These suggestions can help to reduce the cravings and make quitting easier.


How to do self-hypnosis is possible by using relaxation and visualization techniques to help the person reach a state of focused attention. To start, make sure you are in a comfortable place and take some slow, deep breaths. Then, use visualization to imagine yourself in a relaxing place and focus on positive affirmations. Once you are in a relaxed state, you can then begin to make suggestions to yourself about the desired outcome. Our step by step video tutorials will help you to learn how to hypnotize in 5 minutes.

Through hypnosis, a person can learn to become more aware of their eating habits, such as emotional eating, and become more in tune with their body's natural hunger and fullness cues.

Hypnosis against anxiety, Stress relief and big depression. Deep sleep hypnosis for depression anxiety self confidence emotional healing. Hypnosis is a state of human consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion. The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis. Meditation and its effect on brain activity and the central nervous system became a focus of collaborative research in neuroscience, psychology and neurobiology during the latter half of the 20th century. Mindfulness meditation is frequently studied, a Buddhist meditation approach found in Zen and Vipassana.


A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear.","100,000+ downloads","Dec 17, 2016","Jun 16, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zdn35.music.songs.meditation.sleep.hypnosis

Improve your Sleep With Meditation & Hypnosis

If you're looking for a way to improve your sleep, you may want to consider sleep meditation or hypnosis. Sleep hypnosis is a process of guiding your mind into a state of relaxation to fall asleep more easily. Hypnosis can be done with the help of the MindTastik sleep meditation app.

Sleep meditation involves focusing on your breath and letting go of all other thoughts. This can help to calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep. Both relax hypnosis and meditation can be done in bed just before sleep.

Self Hypnosis and Guided Meditation for Anxiety

For many of us, anxiety is a constant battle. Whether it's looming deadlines at work, upcoming social obligations, or simply the stresses of daily life, it can be tough to keep our anxiety under control. But there are some simple things we can do to help ease our anxiety and bring us back to a place of calm. One of those things is self-hypnosis, a form of meditation that helps us focus and relax our minds. By focusing on positive affirmations and breathing deeply, we can enter into a state of relaxation hypnosis which allows us to let go of our anxieties and fears.

Mindfulness is another great tool for managing anxiety and stress. By being present in the moment and focusing on our breath, we can learn to control our thoughts and let go of the stressors that are causing our anxiety.

Both relax hypnosis and mindfulness are excellent tools for managing anxiety.

▌Transform your life by using guided meditation, self-hypnosis, sleep sounds, and affirmations to eliminate negative thinking patterns from your subconscious.
▌Learn mindfulness to get rid of intrusive thoughts and focus on the present moment.
▌Learn new habits with our daily meditations or 7 days anxiety, sleep meditation, and relaxation challenges. The power of self-improvement lies in you!

The app includes a variety of guided meditations, and you can choose from several different relaxation techniques. There are also some great visualizations that you can use to help you relax.

All the other apps for anxiety are missing one point: integrating meditation techniques inside daily life. So, meditation becomes a temporary resort without helping the user acknowledge and be aware of his thoughts and feelings. MindTastik helps you by providing meditation and free mindfulness tips after each audio session you perform.

▌The key to feeling calm and happy is to be conscious of your feelings. Learn how to meditate, sleep well, or have a better day!

"Tune your voice! Learn to sing and get the note right.

Learn, step by step, to recognize and sing the musical notes. SolFaMe includes a voice tuner and a number of exercises designed for amateurs and experienced singers alike.

☆ Features ☆

✓ Learn to recognize each note by its spelling and sound.
✓ Train your musical ear.
✓ Sing musical intervals.
✓ Practice distinguishing sharps and flats.
✓ Write your own sheet music, listen to it or sing it.
✓ Put what you have learned into practice in the various fun games.
✓ Adapted to low and high voice pitches.
✓ Includes notes in Latin (Do Re Mi) and English (A B C) notation.

☆ Sections of the application ☆

The app contains a tuner, in which you can tune your voice to the note you select, being able to see on a staff how close you are to singing the exact note. The tuner can also be used with the piano; use it to tune your instrument and get it ready to play. You can also use it to warm up your voice before singing.

The exercises section is divided into different levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate and advanced), with which you can start from scratch and progress in your learning. It contains a number of distinct types of exercises. Some in which you practice by singing using the microphone and other exercises in which the voice is not needed because the user interacts by screen touching to learn the notation -spelling- and sound of the notes. In addition, it includes a scoring system with which to measure your progress.

The exercises are:

- The musical notes
- Note spelling
- Train your ear
- Sharps and flats
- Sing the notes
- Singing intervals
- Singing sharps and flats

You can compose your own sheet music in the application's editor. Create a composition, listen to it with different instruments and try singing it. This tool allows you to use different types of clefs, time signatures and key signatures.

Also, the app includes a section of (voice-controlled) games to play using your voice as the input mechanism to govern the behavior of a character, so you keep practicing while having fun. Put your vocal cords to the test and warm up your voice with the different exercises. The collection of voice-controled games will continue to expand, so pay attention to the updates.

☆ Recommendations and permissions ☆

It is recommended to use the application in low noise environments, so that the microphone mainly captures your voice or the sound of your instrument. Although it is designed to tune the human voice, try bringing any other instrument (in the appropriate scale) to the microphone: piano, violin... and tell us about your experience. We will continue to work on SolFaMe to offer a great tool to musicians and singers, both for learning for beginners and functionality for veterans.

The application requires permission to use the microphone for the tuner and voice training exercises. SolFaMe does not collect any information or record the user's voice, for more details see the privacy policy.

"The Breathing App (TBA) original is inspired by Resonance Frequency—the scientific term that describes what happens when our heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, and brainwave function align in a coherent wave. This occurs spontaneously when we breathe at a pace of five to seven breaths per minute, resulting in calm, restful alertness and other benefits.

About Resonance Frequency

The effects of resonance support the innate ability of our body, nervous system, and emotions to restore themselves. This is achieved by balancing the two complementary branches of the autonomic nervous system, which governs heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, respiration, and other automatic functions.

How is it possible for one breathing technique to do so much? The answer lies within our nervous system. By breathing at your resonance frequency, you enter into an even balance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system:

The sympathetic branch, which moves us toward activity
The parasympathetic branch, which moves us toward rest

New Updates
Although TBA focuses on Resonance Frequency, we’ve added advanced ratios to expand your breath practice repertoire. These ratios also use our breathing sounds to guide you.

What’s in the App?

TBA includes:
2 Kids Ratios (Free)
4 Resonance Frequency Ratios (Free)
4 Focusing Breathing Ratios (Premium)
4 Energizing Breathing Ratios (Premium)
4 Calming Breathing Ratios (Premium)
4 Grounding Breathing Ratios (Premium)

Each breath group offers beginner through advanced practices to suit your breathing needs.

All breath practices can be done through both nostrils for normal breathing, or through one nostril at a time for alternate-nostril breathing, giving you flexibility in your practice.

Our breath sound feature, along with the expanded section on ratios, is a great teaching tool. Many of the included ratios were created with yoga and breath teachers in mind for use in classes.

Free Features
This is a free app, and the basic features will remain available forever, including:
Kids Ratios and Resonance Ratios
Timers up to 20 minutes
Elegant, simple design
Guiding sounds
No account required

"This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the device using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions.

With this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:

◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).

◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions

◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision.

◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)

◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees.

◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees.

◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.

◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red).

◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode.

For recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers.

"If you have a friend or family member who is going through a hardship, you can also share these healing prayers with them. Keeping them in your thoughts and prayers can bring them peace, just as reading prayers for healing can give you strength.

Let's face it life can be scary. We want to keep our loved ones, children, friends, and even ourselves safe throughout the day, emotionally and physically. It's natural instinct to protect the people we love most. And for those who follow the Lord, we have a little extra help to make sure our family is protected. Reading a prayer for protection can give us an extra feeling of safety and a sense of comfort knowing that God is listening. After all, God is always watching out for us, even when we may not realize it.

Never underestimate what the power of prayer can do in any situation. God knows exactly what we need, when we need it. So whether you're calling for protection on yourself, your home, your children, or simply the world, know that the Lord is listening, and he will answer when the time is right. If you need a powerful daily prayer to give you strength, a prayer for protection will calm your anxieties and remind you that the Lord is keeping watch from above. Say one of these prayers at night to ask for peace and protection, or incorporate a few Bible verses about protection into your routine. Either way, know that God will protect your and your family through the good times and the bad.

Guide our way, Lord, as we go on with our lives today. Also, be our shield as we go back home later. May you always preserve the bond that we have as a family, and may we look forward to seeing each other once again at home.

Prayer is our number one tool for healing what causes pain in our family. Whether physical or emotional pain, God can provide comfort and restoration. Pray for God to heal the bodies, minds and souls of your family members. May the Lord protect and deliver your loved ones from temptation and disease. Use these prayers for family healing and protection to ease your anxiety and put your trust in the Lord!

This application features several inspiring prayers for good health, healing, wellbeing and protection. The first prayer concerns the health of our whole being - mind, spirit and body - and is suitable for personal devotion or for giving to a loved one, family member or friend.

"Syntropy is a very different kind of wellbeing app.

We combine exquisitely beautiful digital art with gorgeous music to create short videos which take you on elevating journeys into relaxation, renewal and revitalisation. Watch any time, any place to de-stress and re-balance within just a few minutes. Or settle down and enjoy a whole series for a deeply immersive and transformational experience.

Syntropy is perfect for both the newcomer and those more experienced at relaxation, breathwork and meditation. The evolving art absorbs your mind and the rhythmic music calms your emotions. Syntropy is a uniquely different and pleasurable way to achieve optimal states.

Syntropy is a collaborative project. We commission art and music from a diverse selection of emerging and established artists from all over the world. We’re passionate about empowering artists and musicians to play their part in helping to heal our stressed, anxious and unhappy society - art and music are powerful medicines! And we’re proud to promote Syntropy’s artists too. We feature them in profiles on our website and we produce interviews with them too, allowing the viewers of their art and music to learn more about them, their creative processes and why they are dedicated to creating art and music for wellbeing.

About the app:
You will have full access to several galleries of amazing video artworks. These are organized into 3 categories - Breathe, Relax and Elevate. Breathe features sublime video artworks for coherence breathwork, each available in either 8, 10 or 12 second breath cycles to suit all preferences. Relax features calming, transcendent abstract visuals and divine soundscapes which you can simply lose yourself in or, if you prefer, use for breathwork or focused attention meditation. Elevate features uplifting and stimulating vibes and visuals to elevate your mood and energy - perfect if you’re feeling a bit low.

Every Monday we feature a Breathe, Relax or Elevate video from our international digital artists and musicians;

All of our videos are presented in both dark and light modes for enjoyment at any time of day or night. You do need a good internet or mobile signal to play the videos but using our download feature means that you can also enjoy videos whenever you are offline - perfect for traveling or those times when you can’t get a good signal for streaming.

Where art meets science:
Syntropy is so effective because it blends art with science.
Geometric, abstract and psychedelic art bypasses the brain’s perceptual networks associated with stored “known” information. When you look at this type of art you don’t see familiar objects that the brain can make sense of; rather, you see beautifully unusual, complex and evolving shapes which defy meaning. In bypassing the known, you open yourself up to the unknown and unconscious. Mandalas and geometries can also lead the brain into Alpha brainwaves and promote open focus and feelings of calm and positivity.

The breathing pacers help you to breathe slowly, deeply and in balance. This type of breathing creates a state called psychophysiological coherence which has various benefits for both the body and brain including improved homeostasis, increased vagal tone and optimal cognitive function. In addition to the beautiful visuals, calming music can also induce psychophysiological changes which reduce stress and anxiety and improve relaxation and mood.

Like the sound of Syntropy? Why not try it free of charge for 7 days? You’ll only be charged after the 30 days and you can cancel any time up until then.

Why did we choose the name Syntropy? Syntropy means the emergence of order from chaos - and that’s exactly what our app helps you to achieve!",500+ downloads,"Nov 17, 2021","Oct 31, 2023",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=syntropy.syntropy

"Proov Power, in your Pocket
​​When paired with Proov hormone test kits, the Proov Fertility & Menopause app transforms your phone into a powerful hormone monitor.

Get rich, hormone data-based insight on your cycle to understand ovarian reserve, find the full fertile window, confirm successful ovulation during the implantation window, and see key hormone balance ratios. Each month, you’ll get your hormone report card including a Proov-exclusive Ovulation Score along with actionable, personalized solutions to promote cycle health and improve your chances of getting pregnant.

Whether you're tracking hormones to maintain a healthy cycle or trying to conceive (TTC), join thousands of women and download Proov Fertility Insight to unlock the power of your cycle. Unlike other ovulation and fertility tracking apps, Proov goes beyond fertile window tracking to get the full picture on your cycle hormones and uncover levels that could be impacting your fertility or how you feel.

Proov uses proprietary algorithms, patented, FDA-cleared technology, and clinically validated fertility research to help you fully understand your cycle hormones.

A clinical study showed that Proov can improve your chances of pregnancy by up to 75%! Our algorithm provides medical-grade levels of your key cycle hormones: FSH, estrogen, LH, and PdG. Just pee, dip a test strip, and scan your test with the app to get your hormone values. Proov Fertility Insight will tell you what your unique hormone patterns mean for you and suggest actionable next steps to support a healthy cycle and ovulation. Best of all, the app is free!

App's icon
------------------
The old app's icon - an eye within a triangle - was representing a prism of alternative look. Apparently for some religious and believes that symbol was offensive.

We don't mean to offend any believes, the app is a result of pure mathematical experimentation on image processing so we changed the icon. The new icon is the hamsa hand - a symbol of protection that believes to bring blessing, power and good luck.

Isn't it like a victory of good against evil?

"applicality proudly presents… Psy Interactive – A valuable assistant for psychology professionals aiming to become a “cannot live without” tool!

Psy interactive is a groundbreaking application helping the therapist to fully collect organize and process all patient’s data including:

A complete Clinical Interview (Demographics, Previous interventions, Significant others, Medical history, Jobs, Studies, Residences, Standards of living, Interests/Activities, Moral values, Sexual life, Families, Childhood history).
Clinical Picture (both therapists and patients point of view).
Reason for visiting.
State of emergency record.
During the treatment process the therapist collects, and can easily access with only a click:

Cognitive Map (Early experiences, Rules/Assumptions/Statements, Core beliefs, Defence Mechanisms, Cognitive Distortions)
Requests of patient,
Symptoms,
Life events (by category),
Diagnoses,
Goals development,
Psychoeducation,
Interventions,
Relapse prevention,
Techniques & worksheets used during therapy.
All of the above are well organized, fully connected and easily accessible with just a click.

But even more, Psy interactive implements some groundbreaking new views and tools like “life timeline” and “personal statistics” graphs, providing valuable information in real time during the therapeutic process. Just try the timeline, where on a single graph you can see all the life events of the patient and extract valuable conclusions regarding interactions and influences.

Techniques & worksheets are posing a great role during therapy. At this end, we provide more than a hundred pre-loaded Techniques & Worksheets at the therapists service. Even more, using the embedded “Techniques generator” the therapist can either customize the provided techniques, or compose completely new ones!

While Psy interactive (therapist) works perfectly as a standalone application, its full power is unleashed when it is used in conjunction with Psy interactive (patient).

At any stage of the treatment process, the therapist can easily send via encrypted email one or more of the techniques forms to his patient. The patient receives the technique into his Psy interactive (patient) app, fills in the form, and returns it to the therapist before the next session. Everything is kept organized and is been filed appropriately. A copy of the technique is kept into both the therapist and patient applications.

Just imagine how much will it help you, to prepare the next session, when you will have the filled technique or worksheet a day or two before the upcoming session!

Last but not least, the embedded calendar will help you organize your sessions. Sessions can also be send to the patient via email.

In the mobile era, all of us in applicality we choose to transform the way psychotherapy is performed, and implement interaction via technology.

Play as male or female; gay, straight, or bi. Will you be a jock or a brain? Popular or ignored? Use your psychic powers to help others, or to take what you want.

Can you solve the case? Can you save the school? And most importantly, can you find a date to the prom?

- Solve mysteries in the classic teen-detective genre with a supernatural twist.
- Find your place in the cutthroat high-school social scene: be an athlete, an actor, a brain, or a rebel.
- Uncover the truth about your small town and its secrets.

"It's An Android Application That Present All Psychiatric Diseases

Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders.[1][2] These include various maladaptations related to mood, behaviour, cognition, and perceptions. See glossary of psychiatry.

Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination. Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used.[3] Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited and used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in 2013 which re-organized the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current research.[4]

The combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice,[5] but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. An inpatient may be treated in a psychiatric hospital. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis (e.g., with epidemiologists, mental health counselors, nurses, psychologists, public health specialists, radiologists or social workers).","10,000+ downloads",,"Jun 26, 2025",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psychiatrie.pro

"By this app, you can use your phone as incident light meter,and you can take a picture of the correct exposure.

This app can measure 'F number' , 'Shutter speed' or 'ISO sensitivity'.
Set these measurement values at your camera.
Change your camera to manual mode when setting the values.

Digital cameras have a built-in exposure meter. However, since the built-in exposure meter is reflective, it may not be able to accurately measure exposure because it is affected by the color or gloss of the subject. In such cases, you can use this application to measure the exposure. This app uses incident light to measure exposure and is not affected by the color or gloss of the subject.
Of course, you can also use this application to take pictures with classic cameras that do not have an exposure meter.


Here's how to use this application
(1) Launch the application.
(2) Point your [Android phone], which is running the app, in front of your subject and point it towards [your camera].
(The sensor for measuring light on your Android phone is located on the front side of your phone, so point your phone towards [your camera].)
(3) Press the ""MEASURE"" button of the application to start measurement.
(4) Press ""MEASURE"" button again to finish the measurement.
(At this point, the measurement value is recorded and you can move away from the subject.)
(5) Set the shooting conditions on the application. For example, if you want to calculate the f-stop, set ISO and SS on the app. The calculated f-value will be displayed on the app.
(6) Turn on [your camera] to manual mode.
(7) Set the ISO/F/SS values displayed on the application to [your camera].
(8) Shoot with [your camera].

"Super 16 is a professional video camera application that allows you to create footage with real-time processing as vintage 16mm and 8mm film cameras do. This application provides extensive functionality for manual control, which can be useful for videographers and filmmakers. With Super 16, you can equally well shoot both atmospheric home footage (in 16mm or 8mm film style), reflecting your best moments, and professional cinematic scenes, or just take photos with a touch of old.


Powerful color adjustment

The application provides a set of >70 filters containing profiles of popular vintage Kodak Vision3 films, black-and-white filters and filters for cinema post-processing. You also have the option of manually preprocess color by changing the temperature, tint, saturation and color correction curve. You can track all changes in the distribution of colors in a frame using a color histogram or waveform monitor.


Physical film emulation

The application allows you to emulate such aspects of analog film shooting as stains and scratches, frame shake (gate weave), flicker, grain, uneven emulsion coating etc. Using pause/continue while recording leaves realistic distortion on frames. You can even choose overscanned film mode to see edges and film strip with holes, and apply film burn at any time you want.


Professional shooting options

Super 16 allows you to change the focus and exposure settings, adjust the zoom for better shooting of various scenes. Camera shoots at authentic 24fps that creates movie effect (if your device supports it). All parameters (including processing features) can be changed during the recording.


Convenience of use

You can create your own presets based on the available processing options. This allows you to immediately use the camera in the configuration you need, without having to re-configure. It is also possible to process existing video files with built-in video editor.
