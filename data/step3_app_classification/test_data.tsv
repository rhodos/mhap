My EMDR	Functioning:  This app facilitates an optimal load of the human brain by displaying a moving object in combination with playing a sound effect. The goal of this is to support the desensitization process step, one of the key components part of the EMDR process.  For the benefit of user convenience, various preferences can be set inside the app with regard to the movement pattern, the color and size of the ball, the background color and the sound effect to be played. It is also possible for some settings to choose for the 'random' option and there are several settings for so-called 'surprise effects'.  Because of the simple user interface of the app, it is also very suitable for children. Furthermore a number of sound effects, as well as the surprise effect of suddenly appearing pictures, will have a positive effect on the imagination of the young user.  Background:  This app is realized in close cooperation with a professional operating in the domain of the mental health care.  The functionality of the app is based on the principle of the much discussed EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) used for trauma processing under the supervision of a professional. The developers of this app therefore advice to only use this app to support therapy by a certified practitioner.  Besides the treatment of trauma the working area of EMDR is expanding strongly. For example experiments have been started with compulsive behavior, persistent cravings and overpowering itch. Since the aspect of self practice with these kind of complaints is already a standardized part of the treatment, it is our expectation that a self-help app like this will obtain a reasonable amount of applicability exactly in this area.  This app is offered for the once only symbolic amount of 1 Euro excl.¬†VAT. The revenue will be used for the purpose of (free) updates to adjust the app even better to the needs of the user based on the received feedback.  Usage:  When you start the app, the menu screen is shown. In the top of this screen you can see the menu bar with the options menu, a control panel in the bottom of the screen and a small status bar in the top left. In the status bar you can see the pattern you have selected, the sound effect you have chosen and the current motion speed.  In the control panel buttons are present to start and stop the movement of the ball. In this panel you can also control the speed and a button is present to activate the full-screen mode. From the full-screen mode it is possible to return to the menu screen by touching the screen in an arbitrary position.  Besides English, this app also supports the languages Spanish, French, German and Dutch.	Mental Health	Other	General	General	Round B

Phobia E-Books	A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.  Phobias can be divided into specific phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Types of specific phobias include those to certain animals, natural environment situations, blood or injury, and specific situations. The most common are fear of spiders, fear of snakes, and fear of heights. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or situation. Social phobia is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them. Agoraphobia is when fear of a situation occurs because it is felt that escape would not be possible.  Specific phobias should be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves. Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with some combination of counselling and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.  Specific phobias affect about 6‚Äì8% of people in the Western world and 2‚Äì4% of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a given year. Social phobia affects about 7% of people in the United States and 0.5‚Äì2.5% of people in the rest of the world. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of people. Women are affected about twice as often as men. Typically onset is around the age of 10 to 17. Rates become lower as people get older. People with phobias are at a higher risk of suicide.

I am - Daily affirmations	How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.  Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you‚Äôre truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.  An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you‚Äôll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.  As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.   There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:  - They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back. - Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you‚Äôre creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. - They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.  *It works on Wear OS: you can use it on your watch.

Exorcist: Fear of the Unknown	"Avaible on [ English, Japanese, German, French, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, Korean, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Polish, Turkish, Spanish Malay, Indonesian ] *** Ghost Hunters Horror Game plunges you into a world of paranormal activities, where you take on the role of a ghost hunter investigating a haunted house once inhabited by a 97-year-old psychopath. During his life, he kidnapped and tortured dozens of people. Rumors say that evil spirits still haunt this place, feeding on the fear of the living. As you explore the house, you must use your skills and tools to survive the terrifying encounters that await you.  Mission:  Your mission is to uncover the dark secrets of the haunted house. Armed with an EMF radar, you must locate the ghost, gather evidence, and identify its type. Capture the ghost on camera to prove its existence and escape the house alive. The more evidence you gather, the closer you come to understanding the horrors that took place within these walls.  Tasks in Ghost Hunters Horror Game:  Enter the psychopath's house and begin your investigation. Use the EMF radar to locate the ghost. Collect evidence to determine the ghost‚Äôs type. Take a picture of the ghost to confirm its presence.  Each task challenges your ability to remain calm under pressure, as the supernatural presence tests your nerves. The more evidence you collect, the more the ghost will try to evade you, making it crucial to act quickly and decisively.  Ghosts:  Phantom: A dangerous ghost known for its ability to fly and pass through walls. The Phantom almost never touches the ground, making it difficult to track by footsteps. However, it is highly sensitive to Smudging, which can weaken its power and drive it away temporarily.  Shade: Also known as a ""noisy ghost,"" the Shade can manipulate objects to spread fear. It can throw multiple objects simultaneously, creating a chaotic environment. Despite its power, the Shade is nearly ineffective in an empty room, where it lacks objects to manipulate.  Banshee: A territorial ghost that attacks when provoked, moving at incredible speeds when its target is far away. Disabling the location‚Äôs power source can neutralize its speed, providing you with a crucial opportunity to escape or gather evidence.  Demon: The most dangerous ghost, known to attack without reason. Demons have no weaknesses and attack more frequently than other ghosts, making them a relentless threat. Encountering a Demon means you must be prepared for a continuous assault with little time to react.  Multiplayer Mode: Ghost Hunters Horror Game features a multiplayer mode where you and your friends can team up to face the horrors together. Whether you're cooperating to uncover the secrets of the haunted house or competing to gather the most evidence, the multiplayer experience is intense and thrilling. The game‚Äôs dynamics change dramatically when playing with others, as you must coordinate your efforts to outsmart and outmaneuver the ghosts. Use tools like the EMF radar and ghost detector apps to track down the spirits, and communicate constantly to avoid falling into the deadly traps set by the ghosts. Survival Tips: Survival in Ghost Hunters Horror Game requires more than just bravery; The EMF radar is indispensable for tracking ghosts, but not all ghosts respond the same way.  Identifying the type of ghost quickly is crucial. Each ghost has its own strengths and weaknesses, and knowing them can give you the upper hand. Stay close to your teammates in multiplayer mode.  While inspired by many paranormal investigation experiences, game offers a unique take on ghost hunting and supernatural encounters. Fans of the horror genre may find similarities in atmosphere to games like Phasmophobia, but this is an entirely original creation with its own distinctive features and mechanics.

Baby sleep sounds White noise	"The Whispy Baby White Noise app will help fall asleep quickly to soothing and relaxing sounds!  Sometimes the child is naughty and nothing can help the parents to calm him down and put him to sleep. It also happens that the baby wakes up every 15 minutes or does not want to sleep in the crib. Perhaps the baby is too tired, but cannot fall asleep on its own - this often happens in newborns!  In the practice of many parents, we have learned that monotonous sounds (the so-called ""white noise""), for example, the clamor of a fan, vacuum cleaner, are more effective as a lullaby for a child's sleep than music or singing.  Also, the baby falls asleep better (as he calms down) to the sounds outside the window, the sound of the rain or the uproar of the street. Sleep becomes deeper, its quality improves. When using white noise, the newborn does not wake up every 20 minutes, which also allows the mother to rest better.  What if there are no such sounds? Our application can make different tones that have a positive effect on the child's sleep:  - rain - fan - hairdryer - air conditioning - ""mom sounds"" - ch-ch-ch, motion sickness - ""in my mother's womb"" - wind - sea, forest, and other sounds of nature - animal sounds - train, car, plane, subway  This app helps the child to calm down, speeds up the time to fall asleep. In the studies conducted, most infants were able to fall asleep to white noise within five minutes, while without it, 25 percent of newborns fell asleep during the same time. The app blocks outside noises that might wake your baby up. Sleep associations have been created that signal the baby to sleep and help him feel safe even in unfamiliar surroundings.  Application features:  - Over 80 ringtones - Loop playback without stops - Timer with smooth start and fade out - Background playback - you can use other applications during playback.
