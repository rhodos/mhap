SolFaMe: Voice tuner & singing	Tune your voice! Learn to sing and get the note right.  Learn, step by step, to recognize and sing the musical notes. SolFaMe includes a voice tuner and a number of exercises designed for amateurs and experienced singers alike.  ☆ Features ☆  ✓ Learn to recognize each note by its spelling and sound. ✓ Train your musical ear. ✓ Sing musical intervals. ✓ Practice distinguishing sharps and flats. ✓ Write your own sheet music, listen to it or sing it. ✓ Put what you have learned into practice in the various fun games. ✓ Adapted to low and high voice pitches. ✓ Includes notes in Latin (Do Re Mi) and English (A B C) notation.  ☆ Sections of the application ☆  The app contains a tuner, in which you can tune your voice to the note you select, being able to see on a staff how close you are to singing the exact note. The tuner can also be used with the piano; use it to tune your instrument and get it ready to play. You can also use it to warm up your voice before singing.  The exercises section is divided into different levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate and advanced), with which you can start from scratch and progress in your learning. It contains a number of distinct types of exercises. Some in which you practice by singing using the microphone and other exercises in which the voice is not needed because the user interacts by screen touching to learn the notation -spelling- and sound of the notes. In addition, it includes a scoring system with which to measure your progress.  The exercises are:  - The musical notes - Note spelling - Train your ear - Sharps and flats - Sing the notes - Singing intervals - Singing sharps and flats  You can compose your own sheet music in the application's editor. Create a composition, listen to it with different instruments and try singing it. This tool allows you to use different types of clefs, time signatures and key signatures.  Also, the app includes a section of (voice-controlled) games to play using your voice as the input mechanism to govern the behavior of a character, so you keep practicing while having fun. Put your vocal cords to the test and warm up your voice with the different exercises. The collection of voice-controled games will continue to expand, so pay attention to the updates.  ☆ Recommendations and permissions ☆  It is recommended to use the application in low noise environments, so that the microphone mainly captures your voice or the sound of your instrument. Although it is designed to tune the human voice, try bringing any other instrument (in the appropriate scale) to the microphone: piano, violin... and tell us about your experience. We will continue to work on SolFaMe to offer a great tool to musicians and singers, both for learning for beginners and functionality for veterans.  The application requires permission to use the microphone for the tuner and voice training exercises. SolFaMe does not collect any information or record the user's voice, for more details see the privacy policy.  ------------------------------------------------------  This app has been created and developed with the collaboration of the ATIC research group of the Universidad de Málaga (Spain).

Hourglass Figure - Curvy Body	Hourglass exercises for a curvy body are predominately going to consist of moves that target the obliques, or the transverse abdominals muscles. An hourglass figure typically consists of a smaller waist balanced by a larger bust and curvier hips.  At Home Slimming Exercises For Women Since it’s hard to spot-reduce fat in just one area of your body, it’s important to focus on overall weight loss if you want to drop inches from your waist. But there are some exercises and workouts that have been proven to be more successful at targeting fat around your midsection. Our workout plans will help you to tone your body with curves in all the right places. The exercises will flatten your stomach, shrink your waist to provide a small waistline, tone your thighs, make your butt rounder and hips wider.  We added leg exercises at home that require no equipment and with instructions videos it's ideal for beginners. If you’re looking for a challenging routine to really smoke your legs and glutes, a lower-body workout with no equipment might not be the first option you think of. But it’s a misconception that you need equipment like barbells, dumbbells, or even resistance bands to really make your muscles work.  The emphasis of what you work on will depend on your natural shape. If you’re already slim all around, you may want to start by building muscle around your shoulders and chest area to get broader on top. If you carry weight around your midsection, you’ll likely want to prioritize whittling that away.  30-day trim waist challenge: slim and tone in just one month Designed to twist-and-turn your way to a slimmer, more toned middle. This program will help you sculpt and tone your waist for a slimmer, leaner look. The best workouts for abs incorporate twisting and turning to help burn fat and sculpt your sides for a long and lean torso - which is exactly what this plan is designed to do! Working the obliques helps to sculpt, tone and cinch your belly and tightens the midsection.  Are you dreaming of an hourglass figure? Most people admire the women in the gym that have itsy-bitsy waists and full, shapely hips. If fuller-looking hips are a preference of yours, our exercises for shapely hips can help. To add some curves to your hips, there are certain muscles that need to be trained regularly. These muscles include your internal and external obliques as well as your abductors and gluteal muscles.  When you isolate a muscle or muscle group consistently, you can strengthen and shape that part of your body. Strengthening your obliques tightens the muscles. Working your hips and glutes will tighten, tone, and lift, to leave you with a more voluptuous hourglass figure.	Not Mental Health				Round B

Bipolar Test+	Bipolar Disorder  Bipolar disorder is a serious chronic mental health condition, characterized by the presence of pronounced mood swings.  The medical condition was previously known as manic depression, and it is estimated that around 3% of the world's population over the age of 18 may be affected at some point in their life cycle.  The causes of bipolar disorder are diverse and not completely known, although it is estimated that the predisposition to bipolarity is largely inherited through genetics, and can be triggered throughout life by factors such as stress, pregnancy and the use of illicit drugs.  Typical treatment for Bipolar Disorder includes medications prescribed by a psychiatrist, psychological therapies, counseling, and education for family and friends.  Although there is no cure for the condition, with proper treatment it can be brought under control and affected individuals are usually able to work, have families and participate in all aspects of community life.  Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder is not an easy task, since it can be confused or present together with other psychological conditions of different course and severity, which makes it essential to go to a mental health professional to obtain a reliable diagnosis and beyond any doubt.   The TABS Bipolar Scale  The Triaxial Bipolar Spectrum Scale (TABS) was developed by Dr. Greg Mulhauser as a tool to help raise awareness of experiences that might be indicative of bipolar disorder in people over the age of 18.  It differs from other bipolar screening tools that can be found on the Internet by explicitly checking for factors that exclude a possible diagnosis, therefore its results may differ radically from those offered by older online tests.  At Psicopedia we have adapted the TABS Scale with the intention of providing a tool for exclusively personal and educational use, which in no case can replace the assessment carried out by a qualified professional in an appropriate clinical context.  It is important to clarify that the results of this test have not been compared with other structured tools (such as the SCID, for example) for the evaluation of validity in terms of sensitivity and specificity.  Therefore, this instrument should not be used to make a diagnosis, but only as a tool aimed at recognizing personal experiences that could suggest a bipolar spectrum disorder.

Deep sleep hypnosis for depression anxiety self confidence emotional healing. Hypnosis is a state of human consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion. The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis. Meditation and its effect on brain activity and the central nervous system became a focus of collaborative research in neuroscience, psychology and neurobiology during the latter half of the 20th century. Mindfulness meditation is frequently studied, a Buddhist meditation approach found in Zen and Vipassana.   A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear."

Another plot twist that Elsa wasn’t ready for is the “curse of hoteliers” that hangs over the city for many years. Nobody’s decor skills have been able to lift it, so Elsa will be the next one to try. Only she can unravel the tangle of intrigues and bring the hotel to prosperity! Put your seatbelt on and prepare for a ride with our merge and home design games!  “My home needs help!”, Elsa thinks.

Light meter for photography	"By this app, you can use your phone as incident light meter,and you can take a picture of the correct exposure.  This app can measure 'F number' , 'Shutter speed' or 'ISO sensitivity'. Set these measurement values at your camera. Change your camera to manual mode when setting the values.  Digital cameras have a built-in exposure meter. However, since the built-in exposure meter is reflective, it may not be able to accurately measure exposure because it is affected by the color or gloss of the subject. In such cases, you can use this application to measure the exposure. This app uses incident light to measure exposure and is not affected by the color or gloss of the subject. Of course, you can also use this application to take pictures with classic cameras that do not have an exposure meter.   Here's how to use this application (1) Launch the application. (2) Point your [Android phone], which is running the app, in front of your subject and point it towards [your camera]. (The sensor for measuring light on your Android phone is located on the front side of your phone, so point your phone towards [your camera].) (3) Press the ""MEASURE"" button of the application to start measurement. (4) Press ""MEASURE"" button again to finish the measurement. (At this point, the measurement value is recorded and you can move away from the subject.) (5) Set the shooting conditions on the application. For example, if you want to calculate the f-stop, set ISO and SS on the app. The calculated f-value will be displayed on the app. (6) Turn on [your camera] to manual mode. (7) Set the ISO/F/SS values displayed on the application to [your camera]. (8) Shoot with [your camera].

Voice can be your mental guide, a source of motivation, and an aid in making important life decisions.  You no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.   EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS  - Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.  - You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.   HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON  We like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.  Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.  Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.  For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again. You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.  Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.   BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES  Hypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.   HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS  - lower anxiety and stress levels - get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits - boost your energy - increase self-motivation - improve mental health  Meditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!

Geo Tracker - GPS tracker	"If you are looking for an excellent GPS tracker, that can work with Open Street Maps or Google, love outdoor activities, or travel - this is the app for you!   Record GPS tracks of your trips, analyze statistics, and share them with your friends!   Geo Tracker can help: • Making the way back in an unfamiliar area without getting lost; • Sharing your route with friends; • Using someone else's route from GPX, KML or KMZ file; • Marking important or interesting points on your way; • Locating a point on the map, if you know its coordinates; • Showing off colorful screenshots of your accomplishments on social networks.   You can view the tracks and the surrounding area in the application using a scheme from OSM or Google, as well as satellite images from Google or Mapbox - this way you will always have the most detailed map of the area anywhere worldwide. The map areas you view are saved to your phone and remain available offline for a while (this works best for OSM maps and Mapbox's satellite images). To record and calculate track statistics only a GPS signal is needed - the Internet is only required to download map images.   While driving, you can turn on the navigation mode, in which the map automatically rotates in the direction of travel, which greatly simplifies navigation.   The application can record tracks while being in the background (on many devices, this requires additional configuration in the system - be careful! The instructions for these settings are available in the application). Power consumption in background mode is greatly optimized - on average, the phone's charge is enough for a whole day of recording. There's also an economy mode - you can turn it on in the app settings.   Geo Tracker calculates the following statistics: • Distance traveled and recording time; • Max and average speed on the track; • Time and average speed in motion; • Min and max altitude on the track, altitude difference; • Vertical distance, ascent and speed; • Min, max, and average slope.   Also, there are detailed charts of speed and elevation data available.   Recorded tracks can be stored as GPX, KML, and KMZ files, so they can be used in other well-known applications like Google Earth or Ozi Explorer. Tracks are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to any servers.   The app does not make money from ads or your personal data. To support the development of the project, a voluntary donation can be made in the application.   Useful tips & tricks to solve common GPS issues with your smartphone: • If you start the tracking please wait a bit until the GPS signal is found. • Restart your smartphone and make sure that you have a ""clear view"" of the sky before you start (no disturbing objects like high buildings, forests, etc.). • The reception conditions are permanently changing because they are influenced by the following factors: weather, season, positioning of satellites, areas with bad GPS coverage, high buildings, forests, etc.). • Go to phone settings, choose ""Location"" and activate it. • Go to phone settings, choose ""Date & time"" and activate the following options: ""Automatic date & time"" and ""Automatic time zone"". It may occur that it takes longer until the GPS signal is found if your smartphone is set to the wrong time zone. • Deactivate the airplane mode in your phone settings.   If none of these tips & tricks helped to solve your issues, deinstall the app and reinstall it again. Be aware that Google uses in their Google Maps app not only the GPS data but also additional data of the current location from surrounding WLAN networks and/or mobile networks.   More answers to frequent questions and solutions for popular issues can be found on the website: https://geo-tracker.org/faq/?lang=en"	Not Mental Health				Round B
