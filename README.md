# mhap
MHAP stands for Mental Health App Profiler. It includes code to extract and analyze information about mental health-related apps. 

To run the code, you should first add the mhap/code directory to your PYTHONPATH, e.g. by adding the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file:
export PYTHONPATH="~/path/to/mhap/code:$PYTHONPATH"
(be sure to replace the path with your own).
